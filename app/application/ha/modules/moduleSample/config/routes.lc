# URI ROUTING
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Note: The following applies to modules only if used as application controllers.
# Routing has no effect on view partials or if modules are used as libraries.
#
# This file lets you re-map URI requests to specific controller functions.
#
# Typically there is a one-to-one relationship between a module URL string
# and its corresponding controller page library/handler. The segments in a
# module URL normally follow this pattern:
#
#   example.com/myModule/handler/ID/
#
# or in case the name of the page library is not equal to the module name
#
#   example.com/myModule/pagelibrary/handler/ID/
#
# or using a sub-directory in myModule/controllers
#
#   example.com/myModule/sub-directory/pagelibrary/handler/ID/
#
# In some instances, however, you may want to remap this relationship
# so that a different page library/handler is called than the one
# corresponding to the URL.
#
# Please see the user guide for complete details:
#
#	http://revigniter.com/user_guide/general/routing.html
# and
# http://revigniter.com/user_guide/libraries/modules.html
#
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------
# RESERVED ROUTES
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# There are only two reserved routes for modules:
#
#	put "myModule/pagelibrary" into gRoute["myModule"][1]["defaultController"] 
#
# This route indicates which controller page library should be loaded if the
# URI contains no data. In the above example, the "pagelibrary" page library
# would be loaded.
# If the "defaultController" route is empty and there is only one URI segment specifying
# the name of the module revIgniter expects that there is a controller named after
# the module and tries to load myModule/myModule.
# If no handler is specified the module's index handler is called which must be composed
# of the controller name followed by the word "Index" so that the route would look like:
# myModule/myModule/myModuleIndex.
#
#	put "" into gRoute["myModule"][1]["404Override"]
#
# This route will tell the Router what URI segments to use if those
# provided in the URL cannot be matched to a valid route, in other words if the controller
# specified is missing. If this route is empty the default 404 error page is provided.
#
# Note: Module routes are relative to application/modules/.
#
# Note: The gRoute["myModule"] array must be numbered and the key number
# for reserved routes must be 1. So custom route key numbers start
# with number 2.
