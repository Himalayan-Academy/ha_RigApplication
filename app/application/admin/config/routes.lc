# URI ROUTING
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This file lets you re-map URI requests to specific controller functions.
#
# Typically there is a one-to-one relationship between a URL string
# and its corresponding controller page library/method. The segments in a
# URL normally follow this pattern:
#
# 	example.com/pagelibrary/method/id/
#
# In some instances, however, you may want to remap this relationship
# so that a different page library/method is called than the one
# corresponding to the URL.
#
# Please see the user guide for complete details:
#
#	http://revigniter.com/user_guide/general/routing.html
#
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------
# RESERVED ROUTES
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# There are three reserved routes:
#
#	put "welcome" into gRoute[1]["defaultController"] 
#
# This route indicates which controller page library should be loaded if the
# URI contains no data. In the above example, the "welcome" page library
# would be loaded.
#
#	put "errors/pageMissing" into gRoute[1]["404Override"]
#
# This route will tell the Router what URI segments to use if those
# provided in the URL cannot be matched to a valid route. It it is
# empty the default 404 error page is provided.
#
#	put "scaffolding" into gRoute[1]["scaffoldingTrigger"]
#
# This route lets you set a "secret" word that will trigger the
# scaffolding feature for added security. Note: scaffolding must be
# enabled in the controller in which you intend to use it.
#
# Note: The gRoute array must be numbered and the key number for
# reserved  routes must be 1. So custom route key numbers start
# with number 2.
#

put "site" into gRoute[1]["defaultController"]
