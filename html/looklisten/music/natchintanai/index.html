<p class="p1"> All my devotees revere as sacred scripture the songs and sayings of Satguru Siva Yogaswami, called Natchintanai, which embody the teachings of our lineage, commanding one and all to "Know thy Self by thy self." Aum.<br />
                --Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami</p>
         
 <p class="p1">This project is dedicated to the next generation of Hindus of all nations, that they may be able to learn, sing and be transformed by the profound teachings of one of the 20th centuries greatest siddhas. If you absorb the teachings of the Natchintanai, you will know the essence of Sanatana Dharma. To sing these songs with understanding and devotion is a sadhana of the highest order. This is a work in progress.</p>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<img src="/html/looklisten/music/natchintanai/img/good-thoughts-cover.jpg" border="1" class="float-left" />
<p>This initiative to propagate the songs of Satguru Siva Yogaswami is a work in progress.  Of the some 300 Natchintanai, we offer a selection of 73 of Yogaswami's songs in Tamil as PDF's with an easy-to-read, non-academic transliteration, English translation and samples audio files with traditional melodies. The focus for the digital archives has been to get recordings by living elders and devotees in Jaffna itself, who sang the songs during Sivayogaswami's time, using tunes that are traditionally used by Sivayogaswami's devotees, sung simply so that anyone can follow them. But we also include some recordings by professional Sri Lankan artists singing Carnatic style using their own unique melodies. Recently there has been some renewed interest in Natchintanai in Jaffna itself. Youth singing competitions have been held. This is a good sign and we may one day get recordings from Sri Lanka itself to include here.</p>
