<h1> Mission Statement </h1>


<p><b>Whereas, it is:</b>

<p><b>Observed:</b> Second and third generation youth of Sri Lankan descent living in Australia, Canada, Europe, US, etc., have been cut off from their motherland, where Saivism was once preserved in it's fullness. The civil war broke the cultural continuity of our ancestral faith. </p>

<p><b>Observed:</b> Youth and young adults from India whose parents or ancient ancestors were worshippers of Lord Siva before the advent of Islamic and British invasions (Kashmir, Gujarat, Kerala, Andra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu all have fabulous old Siva temples from a previous age) have lost touch with their roots.<p>

<p><b>Observed:</b> Stories about God cutting off the head of his son, and replacing it with the head of an elephant to make Lord Ganesha or about a boy cutting off his father's foot for touching the Siva Lingam&mdash;these stories cannot continue to serve as vehicles for our tradition. We need a more rational, understanding of the metaphysics based on the root scriptures: Vedas, Agamas along with the human experiential testimony of our Saivite Sages, and stories written for the 21st millenium.</p>

<p><b>Observed:</b> The paradigm that "you have to know Sanskrit or Tamil or Telegu or whatever" to be a good Hindu, is a dead-end sure-failure strategy for tomorrow's Saivite children around the world.</p>

<p><b>Observed:</b> Many non-Hindus who have taken up the practice of yoga, yearn to "come home" to the spiritual and religious roots of their practice. Lord Siva is the penultimate yogi.</p>

<p><b>We hope to provide a channel for:</b>

<p><b>Clear Understanding:</b> Providing answers that speak to the sophisticated education level and brain power of the current digital generation of youth and young adults.</p>

<p><b>Being Relevant:</b> Our culture needs to be practical, part of our lifestyle and something that works in the lives of real people in the modern world. At the same time opening up doors for growing love in our personal life in family/community and spiritual development on a personal level.</p>

<p><b>Joyful Content:</b> Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswmai by whose grace this web site exists today, said: "Life is meant to be lived joyously." To that end the <i>SivaSiva</i> aims to make be not only informative, but entertaining, including some short innovative media experiences.</p>

<p><b>Engagement:</b> Allowing youth and young adults to have a voice in the discovery process, by providing a safe, non-judgemental, channel to ask questions and bring up issues.</p>
