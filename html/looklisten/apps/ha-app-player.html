<h2> Himalayan Academy Application Player </h2>

<p> The <b>Himalayan Academy Application Player</b> is an engine for PC's (Mac and Windows) that will run Livecode documents which are known as "stacks". This replaces the HAPMAP engine and also the former HAP Player for ATRA used by our transcribers. This engine will run both HAPMAN Manager, ATRA and also offer other modules for beta testing in the future. Note that this is a desktop computer framework and is not meant to run on mobile devices.</p>

<p>If you have arrived here after an upgrade notice, download the current zip file, unzip and test. Then delete your former HAP App Player. Windows users need to be sure to extract the entire zip package/all files in one operation to a single programs folder. Both Windows and OSX may inform you that you are installing an application from an unknown source. You will need to allow your PC to make a security exception to install his app â€” see below. Note that you should never run stacks from untrusted sources, but only from the buttons or index that may open with this HA App Player.. You *could* get Livecode stacks from other locations and use the "Open" button to run them, but it is not recommended.</p>
