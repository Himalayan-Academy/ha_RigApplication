<p><b>June 1, 2016: Announcing the Re-Release of Gurudeva's 1970 Audio Master Course! <a href="/site/search/sub_title/Audio%20Master%20Course">(Click to go to all 12 chapters.)</a></b></p>

<p> Welcome to an index of all the online audio discourses by Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami and Satguru Bodhinatha Veylanswami. This collection consists of almost all the Sun One (weekly) talks given by Gurudeva and Bodhinatha since Gurudeva started the blog known today as "TAKA" in August of 1998. In recent times we have begun to add jewels from the archives of Gurudeva's oral teachings. Stay tuned. You can help us by reporting any oddities or issues with these talks by sending the URL (web address) of the talk and a note to <a href="mailto:studyhall@hindu.org">Study Hall</a>. We want to give a note of appreciation and gratitude to the team that transcribes all these upadeshas: Hitesvara Saravan, Jnanideva Shanmugam, Vayudeva Varadan, Thushyanthan Amirthalingam, Jutikadevi Sivaraja. Click on a year to see all the talks. We hope to refine this view in the future by offering talks organized by category, letting you view the description easily etc. If you have any ideas for future features in the audio realm, please feel free to send them to <a href="mailto:studyhall@hindu.org">Study Hall</a>. We may not have time to write back; but your input will be added to our digital think tank.</p>
