  <h2><a name="foundation" id="foundation">The SHIVA Braille Foundation</a></h2>



  <p><span class="c2">The SHIVA Braille Foundation is a publicly supported, charitable organization.</p>

  <p>Damara first became interested in helping the blind in 1993-1994 while visiting Sri Sri Sri Balagangadharanatha Swamiji's school for the blind in Karnataka, South India. After her second pilgrimage to India in 1995-1996, she worked as a volunteer in this school for 2 weeks. Now acutely aware of the needs of these dear children, she returned to the United States determined to learn Braille and do whatever necessary to provide them with much-needed materials, texts and encouragement.</p>

  <p>Entirely self-taught, using the special braille program, EDIT-PC, her personal home computer, and a Romeo RB-25 portable embosser, she has, since 1996, created and operated <span class="c2">The SHIVA Braille Foundation.</p>

  <p>Damara Shanmugan is the only braille transcriber in the world who exclusively transcribes Saivite Hindu practice and philosophy into braille. Using the award winning books and magazines of her guru, Satguru Shivaya Subramuniyaswami, she carefully transcribes the essence of the mystical Saivite Hindu tradition.</p>

Its terse guidelines and longer explanations provide time-tested practices and disciplines for serious seekers. Book Two of the 2001 Master Course.</p>

The study of this book will prove to be a big step forward on the spiritual path. Brahmachariya is in the broadest sense the harnessing of the instinctive mind, including the sexual nature. Arranged in 7 chapters, this book is part of a daily 45-minute period of worship, study and meditation. To be studied over and over again for several months. Brahmachariya is transmutation, the goal is not to repress the sexual energy, but to transmute it.</p>

  <h2>Your Generous Contributions at Work!</h2><br>

  
    <p>The SHIVA Braille Foundation also supports other philanthropic programs and projects that benefit the blind. Programs such as:</p>



  <p><font color="#339900"><em>Programs for the blind with correctable eye conditions</em>.</font><br /></p>

    <p> Eye surgery and money for the necessary follow-up medications have been provided for various individuals since 1999. As of September, 2001 this program has benefitted 1 adult and 2 small children. Cost of is approximately US $600.00 per person.</p>


  <p ><font color="#339900"><em>Redistribution of used braille books to institutions in need.</em></font><br></p>

  
    <p>This program has placed thousands of braille volumes considered too old for use in North America with institutions in Mexico, India and Africa that need these braille books as learning tools. Expenses are for packing and shipping materials.</p>

<p><font color="#339900"><em>Employing blind proofreaders in India.</em></font></p>

  
    <p>This program insures that transcriptions are of the highest quality. Hundreds of volumes have been proofread. US $1.00 is paid for each <em>volume</em> reviewed.</p>
 

<p><font color="#339900"><em>Braille/Blind Catalyst for Saiva Siddhanta Church.</em></font><br></p>

  <h2><strong><a name="fdp" id="fdp"><font color="#339900">Future Dreams and Projects</font></a></strong></h2>
  We are looking for funding to start the following projects. Your generous donations will help!<br /><br />


  <p><font color="#339900"><em>A new high-speed braille embosser</em>.</font></p>

  
    <p>With the increased requests for Saivite Hindu braille transcriptions, there is a great need for another embosser. The current embosser is over-worked and needs to be used as a back-up instead of the primary embosser. <span class="c2">The SHIVA Braille Foundation is looking for an angel to sponsor the purchase of a new state-of-the-art embosser. Cost US $10,000.00 </p>
 

<br />

  <p><font color="339900"><em>Permanent women's residence for un-married, orphaned blind women.</em></font></p>

  
    <p>This project is much needed in rural Karnataka. If an orphan girl doesn't get married immediately after completing 10<sup>th</sup> standard, where is she to go, what is she to do? Many are reduced to begging at the railroad stations. Future plans are for a suitable location and for the creation of blind-industry projects to help sustain costs and raise self-esteem of the participants by encouraging self-sufficiency.</p>
 

<br />

  

  <p><font color="#339900"><em>Programs that prevent blindness.</em></font></p>

  
    
     <p> Although the SHIVA Braille Foundation is firmly dedicated to helping those already blind and correcting eye problems with surgery, there is a real need to prevent blindness from happening in the first place. Sometimes it is as simple as a single application of salve to the eyes of a newborn.</p>
   

<br />

    <p><font color="#339900"><em>Free Medical Screening Clinics for the Blind.</em></font></p>
 

  
    <p><span class="c2">The SHIVA Braille Foundation hopes to make arrangements with eye doctors and specialists in and near Bangalore, Karnataka, to set up free eye examinations. In this way candidates for eye surgery can be screened and assessed. If you are an eye doctor, or know of one, that would be interested, please contact us at <a href="mailto:damara@shivabraille.org">damara@shivabraille.org</a></p>
