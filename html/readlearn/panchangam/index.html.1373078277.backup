	<b>Planning for life in tune with the universe.</b> <br />
	The Hindu Calendar has Hindu festivals, nakshatra, tithi, rahukala, pradosh, yoga, sunrise/sunset and more. It is a sophisticated tool for planning, not unlike a western farmer's almanac. It provides vital information about astrological factors, planets and stars--aspects of our subtle environment which are unseen but strongly felt. With this esoteric knowledge at our disposal, we come to understand the characteristics of the planets and the stars and how they relate to the human psyche.  <a href="/readlearn/panchangam/panchangam_intro">Read more about the panchangam...</a><br>
