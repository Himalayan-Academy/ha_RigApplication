<p>The whole universe is engaged in endless motion and activity, a dance of change, a ceaseless flow of energies uniting minuscule atoms with mighty galaxies. This pulsating process of creation, preservation and destruction is depicted as the Cosmic Dance of the Great God Siva. His Tandava Dance, consisting of the 108 poses in this poster, betokens His vast complexity and sacred mystery. </p> </ br>
