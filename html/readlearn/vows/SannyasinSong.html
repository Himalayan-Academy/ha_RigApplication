				The Song of the Sannyasin<br>
				By Swami Vivekananda</blockquote>
		</h1>
		<font size="4">Wake up the note! The song that had its birth<br>
			Far off, where worldly taint could never reach,<br>
			In mountain caves and glades of forest deep,<br>
			Whose calm no sigh for lust or wealth or fame<br>
			Could ever dare to break: where rolled the stream<br>
			Of knowledge, truth and bliss that follows both.<br>
			Sing high that note, Sannyasin bold! Say-- Om Tat Sat, Om<br>
			Strike off thy fetters! Bonds that bind thee down,<br>
			Of shining gold, or darker, baser ore;<br>
			Love, hate--good, bad--and all the dual throng,<br>
			Know, slave is slave, caressed or whipped, not free;<br>
			For fetters, though of gold, are not less strong to bind;<br>
			Then off with them, Sannyasin bold! Say-- Om Tat Sat, Om<br>
			Let darkness go; the will-o-the-wisp that leads<br>
			With blinking light to pile more gloom on gloom.<br>
			This thirst for life, for ever quench; it drags<br>
			From birth to death, and death to birth, the soul.<br>
			He conquers all who conquers self. Know this<br>
			And never yield, Sannyasin bold! Say-- Om Tat Sat, Om<br>
			&quot;Who sows must reap,&quot; they say, &quot;and cause must bring<br>
			The sure effect; good, good; bad, bad; and none<br>
			Escape the law. But whoso wears a form<br>
			Must wear the chain.&quot; Too true; but far beyond<br>
			Both name and form is Atman, ever free.<br>
			Know thou are That, Sannyasin bold! Say-- Om Tat Sat, Om<br>
			They know not truth who dream such vacant dreams<br>
			As father, mother, children, wife, and friend.<br>
			The sexless Self! whose father He? whose child?<br>
			Whose friend, whose for is He who is but One?<br>
			The Self is all in all, none else exists;<br>
			And thou art That, Sannyasin bold! Say-- Om Tat Sat, Om<br>
			There is but One--The Free--The Knower--Self!<br>
			Without a name, without a form or stain.<br>
			In Him is Maya dreaming all this dream.<br>
			The witness, He appears as nature, soul<br>
			Know thou are That, Sannyasin bold! Say-- Om Tat Sat, Om<br>
			Where seekest thou? That freedom, friend, this world<br>
			Nor that can give. In books and temples vain<br>
			They search. Thine only is the hand that holds<br>
			The rope that drags thee on. Then cease lament<br>
			Let go thy hold, Sannyasin bold! Say-- Om Tat Sat, Om<br>
			Say, &quot;Peace to all: From me no danger be<br>
			To aught that lives. In those that dwell on high.<br>
			In those that lowly creep, I am the Self in all!<br>
			All life both here and there, do I renounce,<br>
			All heavens and earths and hells, all hopes and fears.&quot;<br>
			Thus cut thy bonds, Sannyasin bold! Say-- Om Tat Sat, Om<br>
			Heed then no more how body lives or goes,<br>
			Its task is done. Let Karma float it down;<br>
			Let one put garlands on, another kick<br>
			This frame; say naught. No praise or blame can be<br>
			Where praiser praised, and blamer blamed are one.<br>
			Thus be thou calm, Sannyasin bold! Say-- Om Tat Sat, Om<br>
			Truth never comes where lust and fame and greed<br>
			Of gain reside. No man who thinks of woman<br>
			As his wife can ever perfect be;<br>
			Nor he who owns the least of things, nor he<br>
			Whom anger chains, can ever pass thro' Maya's gates.<br>
			So, give these up, Sannyasin bold! Say-- Om Tat Sat, Om<br>
			Have thou no home. What home can hold thee, friend?<br>
			The sky thy roof, the grass thy bed; and food<br>
			What chance may bring, well cooked or ill, judge not.<br>
			No food or drink can taint that noble Self<br>
			Which knows Itself. Like rolling river free<br>
			Thou ever be, Sannyasin bold! Say-- Om Tat Sat, Om<br>
			Few only know the truth. The rest will hate<br>
			And laugh at thee, great one; but pay no heed.<br>
			Go thou, the free, from place to place, and help<br>
			Them out of darkness, Maya's veil. Without<br>
			the fear of pain or search for pleasure, go<br>
			Beyond them both, Sannyasin bold! Say-- Om Tat Sat, Om<br>
			Thus day by day, till Karma's power's spent<br>
			Release the soul forever. No more is birth,<br>
			Nor I, nor thou, nor God, nor man. The &quot;I&quot;<br>
			Has All become, the All is &quot;I&quot; and Bliss.<br>
			Know thou are That, Sannyasin bold! Say-- Om Tat Sat, Om</BLOCKQUOTE>
