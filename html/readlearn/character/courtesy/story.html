I think the things I appreciate most in people are courtesy and civility. I truly feel sorry for those who are so self-centered that they care little about others. These are the folks that are always late keeping others waiting without giving their tardiness a second thought often resulting in people no longer inviting them to events. These are the same folks who feel no qualms about failing to keep promises. Many expect others to do their bidding without regard to the other’s needs. The sad part is that they don’t seem to care that their behavior will most probably lead to a lonesome existence and a path that includes few successes.
<br><br>
In my experience the people who are sensitive to those around them, those who go out of their way to be courteous to others without regard to their importance are those who achieve the most in life. Not just the most in material gain but also in a life that includes little animosity and an abundance of caring friends.

You never know when an example of common courtesy will pay real dividends. The following story is a good illustration of what I mean.

<h2>A Lesson In Courtesy</h2>
<h3>Author: Howard J. Chidley</h3>

I read a story recently of how a young man got his start in life through being courteous. This young man was an assistant doorkeeper in the capitol at Washington. His work was to direct people where they wanted to go in that great building. One day he overheard a stranger ask one of the other doorkeepers for help in finding one of the senators from California. The doorkeeper answered in a very discourteous way that it was none of his business where the senators were.
<br><br>
“But can’t you help me?” the stranger said. “I was sent over here because he was seen to come this way.”
<br><br>
“No, I can’t,” the doorkeeper answered. “I have trouble enough looking after the representatives.”
<br><br>
The stranger was about to turn away when an assistant, who had overheard the conversation, said: “If you are from California, you have come a long way, I will try to help you.” Then he asked him to take a seat, and hurried off in search of the senator. He soon brought him to the stranger, who then gave his card to the doorkeeper and asked him to call at his hotel that evening. That stranger was Collis P. Huntington, who was a great railroad official in those days.
<br><br>
When the doorkeeper called upon him that night, Mr. Huntington offered him a position at nearly twice the salary he was then receiving. He accepted the new position and was rapidly promoted from that time on.
<br><br>
The lesson I would have you learn from this is that you never know when a good deed is going to return to you. I don’t mean that you should be courteous, expecting that you are going to be paid for it each time, for the greatest pay for kindness is just the feeling that you have helped someone. As the old saying goes, “Civility costs nothing,” and on the other hand, you never gain anything by getting the ill-will of anybody or anything, even of a dog. Be courteous: it is the mark of a gentleman, of a lady, and it is often the passport to success.
