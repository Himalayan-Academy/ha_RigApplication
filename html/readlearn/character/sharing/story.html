This story is about the time a long time ago when my mother decided that she would invite me to travel with her to the pilgrimage at Lac Ste. Anne, Alberta. Something must have concerned her to want me to go with her. So she surprised me the day she came to pick me up. I told her that I had no money and that I was suffering from having drank a little too much alcohol the night before. My mother assured me that she would take care of everything and that I need not worry. I finally gave in to my motherâ€˜s request and got ready to go to Lac Ste. Anne. 
<br><br>
That was our Indian way. If you've got something, you give it to someone in need. We never charged anybody anything. Those were the days, I was taught to welcome anyone that came to my home; anyone that needed a place to sleep, food to eat or a friend to talk to. I would never close the door to anyone wanting this kind of support. It was important to show that you had a good heart. 
<br><br>
Along the way I needed to have something stronger than pop to alleviate the hangover I had from what I'd drank the night before and asked if we could stop at Smokey Lake, the next town we were approaching. To my surprise my mother brought out a bottle of wine. She had anticipated my request of wanting to stop at every town that we would pass on the highway. I gratefully took the bottle of wine and we proceeded on our journey. Surprised by my mother's actions I remained quiet for some time. 
<br><br>
As we made our way to Lac Ste. Anne we saw a man who was hitchhiking. As I mentioned earlier, anyone needing help must be taken care of and so the opportunity presented itself. This man looked like he needed help so we picked him up. Opening the grub box, my mother handed the man bannock, dry meat and tea. He looked very grateful for the thoughtful gesture. 
<br><br>
As we continued on our journey he explained that the previous night he had been robbed of all his earnings. He was a chef and had been working on a six month cooking contract. That was why he was hitchhiking back to Edmonton. It was a sad situation for this man. 
<br><br>
As we travelled the hitchhiker and I finished the bottle of wine. It did wonders for my hangover. We were coming to the town of St. Albert and had to turn off to continue our journey towards Lac Ste. Anne. I wanted to have a final drink with my newly found friend so we pulled into town and stopped.
<br><br>
After having a drink, it was time for us to part ways. We all gathered in a circle to say our farewell. The hitchhiker suddenly began to cry, overwhelmed by the treatment he had received. Moved by the man's gesture of appreciation each of us in turn began to shed tears. It must have been a sight to behold.
<br><br>
Just before we left, I gave the hitchhiker the last four dollars of the six my mother had given me. He insisted on returning the favour saying that he would send the money back to us as soon as he had some money. I told him to never mind paying it back and that there would come a day when he might run into somebody else who was stuck like he was. I told him to give that person the money. Let him use it on the way he needed to, like for catching a bus home, buying a meal or paying for a coffee, and to tell him the same thing too - about passing the favour on. After I finished speaking we all went our separate ways, happy to have helped someone in need.
<br><br>
While my mother was alive she would remind me of that time and would say, "I wonder where the money you gave away is now?
