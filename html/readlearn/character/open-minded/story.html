<i>To celebrate International Women’s Day, Geeta Menon, Dean of the Undergraduate College & Abraham Krasnoff Professor of Global Business & Marketing, NYU Stern School of Business, shares her story about the defining characteristic that led to her progress.</i>
<br><br>
I don’t believe that any one particular achievement equals success. Instead, I embrace – and even look forward to – the unexpected opportunities that are inevitable in life. In fact, I’ve found that being open to the unknown is what led to my progress.
<br><br>
I learned this early on growing up in India, where my father was an officer in the Indian Navy. My family moved often, and each time we relocated there was uncertainty: What would my school be like? Who would my friends be? Would I like our new community? This formative experience taught me not to fear the unknown. Instead, being open to new perspectives, I found, is a way to experience new – often thrilling –opportunities.
<br><br>
As I grew older, I continued to apply this way of thinking to milestones along the way. While I had a basic blueprint for my life – college, followed by graduate school, working in a field I enjoyed, having a family – I never laid out the precise details. Instead, I’ve always had faith that everything would eventually fall into place. It has – and more.
<br><br>
I’ve had many experiences during my career that have helped me grow both professionally and personally. For example, I have had the good fortune of working for leading business schools in the United States and India, including NYU Stern, Wharton and Indian School of Business, Hyderabad. I did not identify any of these experiences as goals – I did not even target being in academia. Instead I remained open to circumstances that led me to them. While I have been working on research papers, educating students, and involved in the professional community, I’ve also embraced the many other opportunities that have presented themselves.
<br><br>
Today, as Dean of the NYU Stern Undergraduate College, I hear about new ideas and encounter unexpected opportunities every single day. One of the biggest challenges of holding a leadership position is the constant challenge of adapting to an always evolving environment. But with an open mind, this dynamic workplace is also one of untold opportunity. The advice I give my students at Stern is to find the right balance between focus and open-mindedness: Never be too focused that you don’t hear opportunity knocking on your door!
