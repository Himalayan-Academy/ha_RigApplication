<h3 class="h3">Hinduism:</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Hindus believe in a one, all-pervasive Supreme Be ing who is both immanent and transcendent, both Creator and Unmanifest Reality.</li>
	<li>Hindus believe in the divinity of the four Vedas, the world's most ancient scrip ture, and venerate the Agamas as equally revealed. These primordial hymns are God's word and the bedrock of Sanatana Dharma, the eternal religion.</li>
	<li>Hindus believe that the universe undergoes endless cycles of creation, preservation and dissolution.</li>
	<li>Hindus believe in karma, the law of cause and effect by which each individual creates his own destiny by his thoughts, words and deeds.</li>
	<li>Hindus believe that the soul reincarnates, evolving through many births until all karmas have been resolved, and moksha,  liberation from the cycle of rebirth, is attained. Not a single soul will be deprived of this destiny.</li>
	<li>Hindus believe that divine beings exist in unseen worlds and that temple worship, rituals, sacraments and personal devotionals create a communion with these devas and Gods.</li>
	<li>Hindus believe that an enlightened master, or satguru, is essential to know the Transcendent Absolute, as are personal discipline, good conduct, purification, pilgrimage, self-inquiry, meditation and surrender in God. </li>
	<li>Hindus believe that all life is sacred, to be loved and revered, and therefore practice ahimsa, noninjury, in thought, word and deed.</li>
	<li>Hindus believe that no religion teaches the only way to salvation above all others, but that all genuine paths are facets of God's Light, deserving tolerance and understanding.</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="h3">Christianity:</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Christians believe that the bible is the uniquely inspired and fully trustworthy word of God. It is the final authority for Christians in matters of belief and practice, and though it was written long ago, it continues to speak to believers today.</li>
	<li>Christians believe in one God in three persons. He is distinct from his creation, yet intimately involved with it as its sustainer and redeemer.</li>
	<li>Christians believe that the world was created once by the divine will, was corrupted by sin, yet under God's providence moves toward final perfection.</li>
	<li>Christians believe that, through God's grace and favor, lost sinners are rescued from the guilt, power and eternal consequences of their evil thoughts, words and deeds.</li>
	<li>Christians believe that it is appointed for human beings to die once and after that face judgment. In Adam's sin, the human race was spiritually alienated from God, and that those who are called by God and respond to his grace  will have eternal life. Those who persist in rebellion will be lost eternally.</li>
	<li>Christians believe that spirit beings inhabit the universe, some good and some evil, but worship is due to God alone.</li>
	<li>Christians believe that God has given us a clear revelation of Himself in Jesus and the sacred Scriptures. He has empowered by his Spirit prophets, apostles, evangelists, and pastors who are teachers charged to guide us into faith and holiness in accordance with his Word.</li>
	<li>Christians believe that life is to be highly esteemed but that it must be subordinated in the service of Biblical love and justice.</li>
	<li>Christians believe that Jesus is God incarnate and, therefore, the only sure path to salvation. Many religions may offer ethical and spiritual insights, but only Jesus is the Way, the Truth and the Life.</li>
