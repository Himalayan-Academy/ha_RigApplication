	Question Twelve: How do Hindus view other religions?

</h1>
<p>
	<b>A:</b> Hindus honor all religious traditions and the people within them. While regarding our faith as uniquely endowed, we believe that there is no exclusive path, no one way for all.

</p>
<p>
	<br>
	<b>Longer answer:</b> In India, where Hindus are the overwhelming majority, the rights of minority religions have always been honored. Hindus have welcomed, embraced and lived peacefully among other religions for centuries. During those same centuries, Hinduism itself evolved into hundreds of strains, and thus Hindus are fully at home with many different traditions and viewpoints within their own faith. Hence, they are naturally tolerant of other religions, respecting the fact that each has unique beliefs, practices, goals and paths of attainment, and not objecting when the doctrines of one conflict with those of another. Hindus readily accept the idea that it is not necessary, desirable or even possible for everyone to hold the same beliefs. And certainly such differences should never be cause for tension, criticism, intolerance or violence.
<br>
	<br>An ancient Sanskrit verse summarizes the Hindu attitude: &ldquo;As the different streams, having their sources in different places, all mingle their water in the sea, so, O Lord, the different paths which men take through different tendencies, various though they appear, crooked or straight, all lead to Thee.&rdquo;
<br>
	<br>
	Hindus do not proselytize, meaning they do not try to convert members of other faiths to their own. Proselytizing is based upon the belief that one&rsquo;s religion is the only true religion and everyone else should join it. Hindus hold the view that all faiths are beneficial. A devout Hindu is supportive of all efforts that lead to a pure and virtuous life and would consider it unthinkable to dissuade a sincere devotee from his chosen faith. They know that good citizens and stable societies are created from groups of religious people in all nations. While encouraging others to follow their chosen path with dedication, Hindus hold Sanatana Dharma to be the fullest expression of religion, and do accept sincere souls who seek entrance into Hinduism.&nbsp;
<br>
	<br>
	Elaboration: When discussing other religions, Hindu leaders often quote a verse from the <i>Rig Veda</i> (1.164.46): <i>&ldquo;Ekam Sat, viprah bahudha vadanti,&rdquo;</i> meaning &ldquo;Truth is One, sages describe it variously.&rdquo; It conveys a core Hindu idea: that there can be multiple valid viewpoints about the Supreme. Dr. S. Radha&shy;krishnan, philosopher and former president of India, stressed this point: &ldquo;The Hindu recognizes one Supreme Spirit, though different names are given to it.&rdquo;
<br>
	<br>In expressing religious tolerance, Hindus sometimes cite the above verse to assert that all religions are the same. In reality, all religions are not the same, nor is that indicated by this verse. It simply says that all religions revere the One Truth; all believe in the One Supreme Being. Their beliefs and practices are different; their paths are distinct. Instead of saying, &ldquo;All religions are the same,&rdquo; it is better to state that &ldquo;all religions are good.&rdquo;
 <br>
 <br>Hindus share values common to all faiths: piety, love of God, respect for tradition, a stress on duty, responsibility and basic human virtues, such as nonviolence, truthfulness, compassion and charity. They know that good citizens and stable societies are created from groups of religious people in all nations. They also acknowledge and honor the many ways that religions differ. For example, meditation and yoga are commonly practiced in Eastern religions but not usually in Western faiths. 
<br>
<br>The heart of a religion is its understanding of the soul&rsquo;s relationship to God. Hinduism and most Eastern religions believe that, at the highest level, God and soul are one, inseparable, while Western faiths maintain that Creator and creation are eternally distinct.
<br>
<br>Hindus support and participate in ecumenical gatherings with other religions, while upholding their own traditions. They confidently defend their faith, proceed contentedly with their practices and avoid the enchantment of other ways, be they ancient or modern.
