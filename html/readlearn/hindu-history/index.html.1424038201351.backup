<p>
	The history of India and Hinduism are important for all Hindus. Especially for youth, an authentic account of their religious and cultural traditions provides a strong sense of roots. Unfortunately in the West, and even in India itself since Independence, the academic presentations of Indian history and Hinduism are highly flawed, being done by those outside the tradition. They are deeply influenced by modern trends such as secular humanism, scientific materialism, Marxist thinking and atheism. In educational social studies text books there is an incredibly strong editorial bias to show all things good, wholesome, praiseworthy and religious in the time line of Abrahamic religions, completely avoiding such horrors as the crusades, inquisition of the Christian faith and the spread of Abrahamic religions by the sword through time. But for Hinduism the focus is almost always on what are perceived as negative features of India's social landscape. This has led to the production of school texts that present Hinduism to young people in a very bad light. Himalayan Academy Publications, though its flagship magazine, Hinduism Today and new books, is working to help correct the problem by producing publications that provide an historically accurate view from the Hindu perspective. 
</p>
<p>
	The July, 2014, release of the 23-minute movie "History of Hinduism, Part 1" represents a milestone in this work. Years of work to produce a set of professionally prepared grade-school texts has been turned into a video to convey the truth to today's web-facing generation. This video specifically covers the historical time period usually taught in 6th or 7th grade social studies in the US and is an appropriate supplemental resource for such classes. 
</p>
<p>
	The movie has also been done with subtitles in several other languages. If you would like to help translate this video into other languages, please contact <a href="mailto:studyhall@hindu.org"> studyhall@hindu.org </a> . 
</p>
<p>
	Below we list links to resources that may be of use to you in your community or school. Many grade school teachers have discretionary options to choose cirriculum materials for their classes. We encourage you to get these lessons and help correct the decades of ignorance that have plagued the teaching about India and Hinduism in today's schools.

This presentation will explain how the course material is created and adopted, and how Hindus can improve the process. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8n9P59Y3z5U">Click here to view on YouTube.</a>

	</li>
	<li> <strong> Dr. Shiva Bajpai </strong> is a renowned Indologist and the foremost expert on medieval India in the USA. He obtained a PhD in history from the University of London in 1967, and currently is Professor Emeritus at the California State University of Northridge. He is co-author of the monumental work <em>A Historical Atlas of South Asia.</em>  The California Sate Board of Education hired him as a historian advisor on the textbook controversy. He shares his opinion of the final result of his cooperation with  <em>Hinduism Today,</em> 
	<quote> "I have been closely involved with the production of the Hinduism Today&#039;s 16 -page Hindu History Lesson. I have read the manuscript twice and of my additions, suggestions and corrections have been incorporated. While others might do some topics or themes some what differently, it would be extremely difficult to make any significant improvements within the limitations of space and targeted sixth grade audience. There are certain things which even I would like to rephrase or rework differently, and one might have reservations concerning some other marginal points. But the entire 16-page Hindu History Lesson piece is both correct and authentic and definitely the best that I have seen in any school textbook. Hinduism Today deserves our sincere appreciation and gratitude for producing this positive and constructive account of Hinduism and Hindu History for the 6th grade students anywhere in the world. </quote> <br /> <quote> In fact, if each Hindu were to learn and remember this 16-page narrative, the Hindu community would be better off in this increasingly overt religiously plural society. The crucial problem with the Hindus has been their inability to succinctly describe Hinduism as a whole or to briefly explain it to others in a complete manner. The Hinduism Today narrative will go a long way in redressing this prevailing disability. I endorse it whole-heartedly and without reservations. It should be a required reading for every Hindu and it should serve as a challenge to improve it further. In fact, I am going to make it a part of the required reading assignments to my students of Modern India, a senior undergraduate and graduate course which I am teaching this semester at CSUN.
