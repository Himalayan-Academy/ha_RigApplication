<p>The history of India and Hinduism are important for all Hindus. Especially for youth, an authentic account of their religious and cultural traditions provides a strong sense of roots. Unfortunately in the West, and even in India itself since Independence, the academic presentations of Indian history and Hinduism are highly flawed, being done by those outside the tradition. They are deeply influenced by modern trends such as secular humanism, scientific materialism, Marxist thinking and atheism. In educational social studies text books there is an incredibly strong editorial bias to show all things good, wholesome, praiseworthy and religious in the time line of Abrahamic religions, completely avoiding such horrors as the crusades, inquisition of the Christian faith and the spread of Abrahamic religions by the sword through time. But for Hinduism the focus is almost always on what are perceived as negative features of India's social landscape. This has led to the production of school texts that present Hinduism to young people in a very bad light. Himalayan Academy Publications, though its flagship magazine, Hinduism Today and new books, is working to help correct the problem by producing publications that provide an historically accurate view from the Hindu perspective.</p>

<p>The July, 2014, release of the 23-minute movie "History of Hinduism, Part 1" represents a milestone in this work. Years of work to produce a set of professionally prepared grade-school texts has been turned into a video to convey the truth to today's web-facing generation. This video specifically covers the historical time period usually taught in 6th or 7th grade social studies in the US and is an appropriate supplemental resource for such classes.</p> 

<p>The movie has also been done with subtitles in several other languages. If you would like to help translate this video into other languages, please contact <a href="mailto:studyhall@hindu.org">studyhall@hindu.org</a>.</p>

<p>Below we list links to resources that may be of use to you in your community or school. Many grade school teachers have discretionary options to choose cirriculum materials for their classes. We encourage you to get these lessons and help correct the decades of ignorance that have plagued the teaching about India and Hinduism in today's schools.
