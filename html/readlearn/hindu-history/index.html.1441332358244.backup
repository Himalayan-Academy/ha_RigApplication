		<a name="book-links"> The Book</a> &mdash;History of Hindu India, Part 1 
</h2>		

<p>
	The history of today's Hindus, one-sixth of our human race, extends back beyond recorded history. In <i>The History of Hindu India</i>, we pick up the threads of Hindu practice evident in the Indus-Sarasvati civilization, which was the largest and in many ways the most advanced of the ancient civilizations. From there we trace the development of Hinduism through the early empires of India, a time of great advances in science, architecture, art and literature--during which Europe was experiencing the Middle Ages. Then came the years of trial by invasion, followed by colonization and finally, in the 20th century, independence. Throughout these periods of history, we highlight the people, philosophical ideas and religious practices that are key to the Hindu religion today.
<p>	
	<i>The History of Hindu India</i> is written for sixth or seventh grade world history and social studies classes in US schools. It is intended to correct the highly deficient presentation of India and the Hindu religion  in the existing books, all of which reduce Hinduism to a single concept: caste. As it covers Hinduism and Indian history right up to the present day, it is also suitable for high-school world religions and Advanced Placement history classes. <i>The History of Hindu India</i> has even been used in college course work, due to its refreshingly authentic, terse but comprehensive presentation of the world's most ancient faith.
<p>	
	Hinduism Today magazine, published by Himalayan Academy, has long been engaged in an effort with other Hindu organizations to correct the teaching of the history of India and Hinduism in US schools. For detailed information on this multi-faceted effort, click:

	<a name="movie-links"> The Video</a>&mdash;History of Hindu India, Part 1 
</h2>

<div id="youtube-versions">

<p>
	The July, 2014, release of the 23-minute movie "History of Hinduism, Part 1" represents a milestone in this effort. Years of work to produce a set of professionally prepared grade-school texts has been turned into a video to convey the truth to today's web-facing generation. This video specifically covers the historical time period usually taught in 6th or 7th grade social studies in the US and is an appropriate supplemental resource for such classes. The movie has also been done with subtitles in several other languages. It has been viewed more then 500,000 times on YouTube as of August, 2015.

<p>
	Below we list links to resources that may be of use to you in your community or school. Many grade-school teachers have discretionary options to choose cirriculum materials for their classes. We encourage you to get these lessons and help correct the decades of ignorance that have plagued the teaching about India and Hinduism in today's schools.

	<b>  Chapter One, Hinduism from Ancient Times </b> <br />
	The largest civilization in the ancient world developed in the Indus Valley of India over 5,000 years ago. In the thousands of years that followed, India produced many great empires under which science, art and philosophy flourished. Out of this rich history developed the Hindu religion, today the third largest in the world.

	 During these eight centuries, empires, religion, commerce, science, technology, literature and art flourished in India. In ways vitally important to Hindus to this day, the Hindu faith was advanced by temple building, the Bhakti Movement, holy texts and great philosophers, saints and sages.

	<b>  Chapter Three, Hinduism Endures: 1100 to 1850 </b> <br />
	By both armed resistance and spiritual resolve, India responded to centuries of Muslim invasion and rule and later British colonization. The country remained overwhelming Hindu despite foreign domination and religious oppression. India is one of very few ancient societies to survive into modern times with its religion and social structure largely intact.

	The British Crown took over direct control of India from the East India Company in 1858. Economic exploitation increased. A determined and mostly nonviolent freedom movement emerged and finally succeeded, resulting in the formation of modern India and Muslim Pakistan in 1947.

	India was suppressed by centuries of Muslim and British foreign rule. But after independence in 1947, its founders succeeded in welding together the ancient land into a strong, united, modern nation. The Hindu religion survived intact and thrives today in the world’s largest democracy.

<p>
	Hinduism Today has just begun collecting endorsements for this lesson from community leaders, Hindu organizations and academics. Following is a list of those received initially. First is the endorsement of Dr. Shiva Bajpai, the main consultant for the creation of the book. Below you will find luminaries such as Dr. Klaus Klostermeier, Distinguished Professor of the University of Manitoba, Canada, and Dr. Jeffrey Long, Associate Professor at Elizabethtown College in Pennsylvania. Each name is linked to a PDF file of the full review which will download to your computer and open in your PDF viewer.

<ul>
	<li> <strong> Dr. Shiva Bajpai </strong> is a renowned Indologist and the foremost expert on medieval India in the USA. He obtained a PhD in history from the University of London in 1967, and currently is Professor Emeritus at the California State University of Northridge. He is co-author of the monumental work <em>A Historical Atlas of South Asia.</em>  The California State Board of Education hired him as a historian advisor on the textbook controversy. He shares his opinion of the final result of his cooperation with  <em>Hinduism Today,</em> 
</li>	<quote> "I have been closely involved with the production of the Hinduism Today&#039;s 16 -page Hindu History Lesson. I have read the manuscript twice and of my additions, suggestions and corrections have been incorporated. While others might do some topics or themes some what differently, it would be extremely difficult to make any significant improvements within the limitations of space and targeted sixth grade audience. There are certain things which even I would like to rephrase or rework differently, and one might have reservations concerning some other marginal points. But the entire 16-page Hindu History Lesson piece is both correct and authentic and definitely the best that I have seen in any school textbook. Hinduism Today deserves our sincere appreciation and gratitude for producing this positive and constructive account of Hinduism and Hindu History for the 6th grade students anywhere in the world. </quote> <br /> <quote> In fact, if each Hindu were to learn and remember this 16-page narrative, the Hindu community would be better off in this increasingly overt religiously plural society. The crucial problem with the Hindus has been their inability to succinctly describe Hinduism as a whole or to briefly explain it to others in a complete manner. The Hinduism Today narrative will go a long way in redressing this prevailing disability. I endorse it wholeheartedly and without reservation. It should be a required reading for every Hindu and it should serve as a challenge to improve it further. In fact, I am going to make it a part of the required reading assignments to my students of Modern India, a senior undergraduate and graduate course which I am teaching this semester at CSUN.
