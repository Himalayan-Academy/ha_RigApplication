<h3>discussion notes</h3>

Abstract: now that the design is set, we can focus on our routing patterns for users of the website. <br /><br />
<ul>
	<li> "Quick" and "Other popular resources" links on top portal pages<br />
		What should they be? Right now they are changing, but if we look at apple and Nat Geo we see that they have a standard list of links, listed with bold specific descriptions. The user can feel secure knowing the links at the bottom of the page dont change, and when they click on "view all" they are being taken to every resource and not missing any content. </li>
	<li>View all<br />
	We need to fix all View All links for parents and teachers pages so they see every resource available, right now the link can almost be considered a dead link, due to it leading you to one piece of content. </li>
