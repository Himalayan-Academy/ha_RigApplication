The presence of <i>anava mala</i> is what causes the misapprehension about the nature of God, soul and world, the notion of being separate and distinct from God and the universe. <i>Anava</i> obscures the natural wisdom, light, unity and humility of the soul and allows spiritual ignorance, darkness, egoity and pride to manifest. It is inherent in a maturing soul, like the shell of a seed. When <i>anava</i> is ripe, <i>anugraha,</i> "grace," comes, and <i>anava</i> falls away. <i>Anava</i> is the root <i>mala</i> and the last bond to be dissolved.  </p>

<p class="definition">Often spelled <i>Om.</i> The mystic syllable of Hinduism, placed at the beginning of most sacred writings. As a <i>mantra,</i> it is pronounced <i>aw</i> (as in <i>law</i>), <i>oo</i> (as in <i>zoo</i>)<i>, mm</i>. Aum represents the Divine, and is associated with Lord Ganesha, for its initial sound "aa," vibrates within the <i>muladhara,</i> the <i>chakra</i> at the base of the spine upon which this God sits. The second sound of this <i>mantra,</i> "oo," vibrates within the throat and chest <i>chakras,</i> the realm of Lord Murugan, or Kumara, known by the Hawaiian people as the God Ku. The third sound, <i>"</i>mm," vibrates within the cranial <i>chakras, ajna</i> and <i>sahasrara,</i> where the Supreme God reigns. The dot above, called <i>anusvara,</i> represents the Soundless Sound, Paranada. Aum is explained in the <i>Upanishads</i> as standing for the whole world and its parts, including past, present and future. It is from this primal vibration that all manifestation issues forth. Aum is the primary, or <i>mula</i> <i>mantra,</i> and often precedes other <i>mantras.</i> It may be safely used for chanting and <i>japa</i> by anyone of any religion. Its three letters represent the three worlds and the powers of creation, preservation and destruction. In common usage in several Indian languages, <i>aum</i> means "yes, verily" or "hail."  </p>

<p class="word-entry">aura</p>
<p class="definition">The luminous colorful field of subtle energy radiating within and around the human body, extending out from three to seven feet. The colors of the aura change constantly according to the ebb and flow of one's state of consciousness, thoughts, moods and emotions. Higher, benevolent feelings create bright pastels; base, negative feelings are darker in color. Thus, auras can be seen and "read" by clairvoyants. The general nature of auras varies according to individual unfoldment. Great mystics have very bright auras, while instinctive persons are shrouded in dull shades. The aura consists of two aspects, the outer aura and the inner aura. The outer aura extends beyond the physical body and changes continuously, reflecting the individual's moment-to-moment panorama of thought and emotion. The inner aura is much more constant, as it reflects deep-seated subconscious patterns, desires, repressions and tendencies held in the sub-subconscious mind. Those colors which are regularly and habitually reflected in the outer aura are eventually recorded more permanently in the inner aura. The colors of the inner aura permeate out through the outer aura and either shade with sadness or brighten with happiness the normal experiences of daily life. The inner aura hovers deep within the astral body in the chest and torso and looks much like certain "modern-art" paintings, with heavy strokes of solid colors here and there. In Sanskrit, the aura is called <i>prabhamandala,</i> "luminous enclosure," or <i>diptachakra,</i> "nimbus (circle) of light."  </p>

The exact <i>ayanamsha</i> is not known, so a number of <i>ayanamshas</i> are put forth by various astronomers and well-known astrologers.

<p class="definition">"Science of life." A holistic system of medicine and health native to ancient India. This sacred Vedic science is an <i>Upaveda</i> of the <i>Atharva Veda</i>. Three early giants in this field who left voluminous texts are Charaka, Susruta and Vagbhata. <i>Ayurveda</i> covers many areas, including: 1) <i>chikitsa,</i> general medicine, 2) <i>shalya,</i> surgery, 3) <i>dehavritti,</i> physiology, 4) <i>nidana,</i> diagnosis, 5) <i>dravyavidya,</i> materia medica and pharmacology, 6) <i>agada tantra,</i> antidotes, 7) <i>stritantra,</i> gynecology, 8) <i>pashu vidya,</i> veterinary science, 9) <i>kaumara bhritya,</i> pediatrics, 10) <i>urdhvanga,</i> diseases of the organs of the head, 11) <i>bhuta vidya,</i> demonology, 12) <i>rasayana,</i> tonics, rejuvenating, 13) <i>vajikarana,</i> sexual rejuvenation. Among the first known surgeons was Susruta (ca 600 BCE), whose <i>Sushruta Samhita</i> is studied to this day. (Hippocrates, Greek father of western medicine, lived two centuries later.) The aims of <i>ayurveda</i> are <i>ayus, "</i>longevity," and <i>arogya, "</i>diseaselessness," which facilitate progress toward ultimate spiritual goals. Health is achieved by balancing energies (especially the <i>doshas,</i> bodily humors) at all levels of being, subtle and gross, through innumerable methods, selected according to the individual's constitution, lifestyle and nature.

Saint Sambandar described <i>bhakti</i> as religion's essence and the surest means to divine union and liberation. He advised heartfelt worship, unstinting devotion and complete surrender to God in humble, committed service. From the beginning efforts of <i>bhakti</i> to advanced devotion, called <i>prapatti,</i> self-effacement is an integral part of Hindu, even all Indian, culture. <i>Bhakti yoga</i> is embodied in Patanjali's Yoga Darshana in the second limb, <i>niyamas</i> (observances), as devotion (Ishvarapranidhana). <i>Bhakti yoga</i> is practiced in many Hindu schools, and highly developed in Vaishnavism as a spiritual path in itself, leading to perfection and liberation.

<p class="definition">"Food-blessing chant." As each meal is served, reciting the food-blessing chant, silently or aloud as a group, is an expression of gratitude, an acknowledgement of food's ultimate source and an invocation of spiritual benefits. Its recitation prepares one for partaking of the Supreme Lord's abundance, which should occur in the right state of mind and emotion. Food, the magical source of <i>prana,</i> is an umbilical connection to the cosmos, the lifeline of embodied souls, nature's means of nourishment. This chant is given in the spirit of a beggar humbly seeking alms. Water -- a <i>pranic</i> bridge between the subtle and physical universes -- is used in four ways in preparing to eat. First the mouth is rinsed. Then water is used to rinse the banana leaf or plate. Water from one's drinking cup is poured into the right hand to rinse it, as food is, whenever possible, taken with the hand, rather than with chopsticks or fork and spoon. Finally, water is sprinkled in a circle around the food with the right hand, creating a force field of purification and protection and invoking harmony of all five bodily <i>pranas</i>. In the South of India, a little bit from each food item is placed on the upper left corner of the plate as an offering to Ganesha before taking one's first bite.  </p>

Instead he taught that man should seek to overcome greed, hatred and delusion and attain enlightenment through realizing the Four Noble Truths and following the Eightfold Path. Buddhism arose out of Hinduism as an inspired reform movement which rejected the caste system and the sanctity of the <i>Vedas.</i> It is thus classed as <i>nastika,</i> "unbeliever," and is not part of Hinduism. Buddhism eventually migrated out of India, the country of its origin, and now enjoys a following of over 350 million, mostly in Asia. Prominent among its holy books is the <i>Dhammapada.</i>  </p>

<p class="word-entry">conscience</p>
<p class="definition">The inner sense of right and wrong, sometimes called "the knowing voice of the soul." However, the conscience is affected by the individual's training and belief patterns, and is therefore not necessarily a perfect reflection of <i>dharma.</i> In Sanskrit the conscience is known as <i>antaryamin,</i> "inner guide," or <i>dharmabuddhi,</i> "moral wisdom." Other terms are <i>sadasadvichara shakti,</i> "good-bad reflective power" and <i>samjnana,</i> "right conception." It is the subconscious of the person -- the sum total of past impressions and training -- that defines the creedal structure and colors the conscience and either clearly reflects or distorts superconscious wisdom. If the subconscious has been impressed with Western beliefs, for example, of Christianity, Judaism, existentialism or materialism, the conscience will be different than when schooled in the Vedic <i>dharma</i> of Shaktism, Smartism, Saivism or Vaishnavism. This psychological law has to do with the superconscious mind working through the subconscious (an interface known as the subsuperconscious) and explains why the <i>dharma</i> of one's <i>sampradaya</i> must be fully learned as a young child for the conscience to be free of conflict. The Sanatana Dharma, fully and correctly understood, provides the purest possible educational creedal structure, building a subconscious that is a clear, unobstructing channel for superconscious wisdom, the soul's innate intelligence, to be expressed through the conscience. Conscience is thus the sum of two things: the superconscious knowing (which is the same in all people) and the creedal belief structure through which the superconscious flows. This explains why people in different cultures have different consciences.  </p>

<p class="word-entry">conversion to Hinduism</p>
<p class="definition">Entering Hinduism has traditionally required little more than accepting and living the beliefs and codes of Hindus. This remains the basic factor of adoption, although there are, and always have been, formal ceremonies recognizing an individual's entrance into the religion, particularly the <i>namakarana,</i> or naming rite. The most obvious sign of true sincerity of adoption or conversion is the total abandoning of the former name and the choosing of the Hindu name, usually a theophoric name derived from the name of a God or Goddess, and then making it legal on one's passport, identity card, social security card and driver's license. This name is used at all times, under all circumstances, particularly with family and friends. This is severance. This is adoption. This is embracing Hinduism. This is conversion. This is true sincerity and considered by born members as the most honorable and trusted testimony of those who choose to join the global congregation of the world's oldest religion. Many temples in India and other countries will ask to see the passport or other legally valid identification before admitting devotees of non-Indian origin for more than casual worship. It requires nothing more than a genuine commitment to the faith. Belief is the keynote of religious conviction, and the beliefs vary greatly among the different religions of the world. What we believe forms our attitudes, shapes our lives and molds our destiny. To choose one's beliefs is to choose one's religion. Those who find themselves at home with the beliefs of Hinduism are, on a simple level, Hindu. Formally entering a new religion, however, is a serious decision. Particularly for those with prior religious ties it is sometimes painful and always challenging.  The acceptance of outsiders into the Hindu fold has occurred for thousands of years. As Swami Vivekananda once said, "Born aliens have been converted in the past by crowds, and the process is still going on." Dr. S. Radhakrishnan confirms the <i>swami's</i> views in a brief passage from his well known book <i>The Hindu View of Life:</i> "In a sense, Hinduism may be regarded as the first example in the world of a missionary religion. Only its missionary spirit is different from that associated with the proselytizing creeds. It did not regard it as its mission to convert humanity to any one opinion. For what counts is conduct and not belief. Worshipers of different Gods and followers of different rites were taken into the Hindu fold. The ancient practice of <i>vratyastoma,</i> described fully in the <i>Tandya Brahmana,</i> shows that not only individuals but whole tribes were absorbed into Hinduism. Many modern sects accept outsiders. <i>Dvala's Smriti</i> lays down rules for the simple purification of people forcibly converted to other faiths, or of womenfolk defiled and confined for years, and even of people who, for worldly advantage, embrace other faiths."  </p>

<p class="word-entry">cosmic cycle</p>
<p class="definition">One of the infinitely recurring periods of the universe, comprising its creation, preservation and dissolution. These cycles are measured in periods of progressive ages, called <i>yugas.</i> Satya (or Krita), Treta, Dvapara and Kali are the names of these four divisions, and they repeat themselves in that order, with the Satya Yuga being the longest and the Kali Yuga the shortest. The comparison is often made of these ages with the cycles of the day: Satya Yuga being morning until noon, the period of greatest light or enlightenment, Treta Yuga afternoon, Dvapara evening, and Kali Yuga the darkest part of the night. Four <i>yugas</i> equal one <i>mahayuga.</i> Theories vary, but by traditional astronomical calculation, a <i>mahayuga</i> equals 4,320,000 solar years (or 12,000 "divine years" (one divine year is 360 solar years) -- with the Satya Yuga lasting 1,728,000 years, Treta Yuga 1,296,000 years, Dvapara Yuga 864,000 years, and Kali Yuga 432,000 years. Mankind is now experiencing the Kali Yuga, which began at midnight, February 18, 3102 BCE (year one on the Hindu calendar [see Hindu Timeline]) and will end in approximately 427,000 years. (By another reckoning, one <i>mahayuga</i> equals approximately two million solar years.) A dissolution called <i>laya</i> occurs at the end of each <i>mahayuga</i>, when the physical world is destroyed by flood and fire. Each destructive period is followed by the succession of creation <i>(srishti),</i> evolution or preservation <i>(sthiti)</i> and dissolution <i>(laya).</i> A summary of the periods in the cosmic cycles: *1 <i>mahayuga</i> = 4,320,000 years (four <i>yugas) </i>*71 <i>mahayugas</i> = 1 <i>manvantara</i> or <i>manu</i> (we are in the 28th <i>mahayuga</i>) *14 <i>manvantaras</i> = 1 <i>kalpa</i> or day of Brahma (we are in the 7th <i>manvantara</i>) *2 <i>kalpas</i> = 1 <i>ahoratra</i> or day and night of Brahma *360 <i>ahoratras</i> = 1 year of Brahma *100 Brahma years = 309,173,760,000,000 years, one "lifetime" of Brahma, *or the universe, (we are in Brahma Year 51 of the current cycle.  At the end of every <i>kalpa</i> or day of Brahma a greater dissolution, called <i>pralaya</i> (or <i>kalpanta, "</i>end of an eon"), occurs when both the physical and subtle worlds are absorbed into the causal world, where souls rest until the next <i>kalpa</i> begins. This state of withdrawal or "night of Brahma," continues for the length of an entire kalpa until creation again issues forth. After 36,000 of these dissolutions and creations there is a total, universal annihilation, <i>mahapralaya,</i> when all three worlds, all time, form and space, are withdrawn into God Siva. After a period of total withdrawal a new universe or lifespan of Brahma begins. This entire cycle repeats infinitely. This view of cosmic time is recorded in the <i>Puranas</i> and the <i>Dharma Shastras.</i>  </p>

<p class="word-entry">cremation</p>
<p class="definition"><i>Dahana.</i> Burning of the dead. Cremation is the traditional system of disposing of bodily remains, having the positive effect of releasing the soul most quickly from any lingering attachment to the earth plane. In modern times, cremation facilities are widely available in nearly every country, though gas-fueled chambers generally take the place of the customary wood pyre. Embalming, commonly practiced even if the body is to be cremated, is ill-advised, as it injures the astral body and can actually be felt by the departed soul, as would an autopsy. Should it be necessary to preserve the body a few days to allow time for relatives to arrive, it is recommended that dry ice surround the body and that the coffin be kept closed. Arrangements for this service should be made well in advance with the mortuary. Note that the remains of enlightened masters are sometimes buried or sealed in a special tomb called a <i>samadhi.</i> This is done in acknowledgement of the extraordinary attainment of such a soul, whose very body, having become holy, is revered as a sacred presence, <i>sannidhya,</i> and which not infrequently becomes the spiritual seed of a temple or place of pilgrimage.  </p>

Hindus know death to be the soul's detaching itself from the physical body and continuing on in the subtle body <i>(sukshma sharira)</i> with the same desires, aspirations and activities as when it lived in a physical body. Now the person exists in the in-between world, the subtle plane, or Antarloka, with loved ones who have previously died, and is visited by earthly associates during their sleep. Hindus do not fear death, for they know it to be one of the most glorious and exalted experiences, rich in spiritual potential. Other terms for death include <i>panchatvam</i> (death as dissolution of the five elements), <i>mrityu</i> (natural death), <i>prayopavesha</i> (self-willed death by fasting), <i>marana</i> (unnatural death, e.g., by murder).  </p>

<p class="definition">From the Latin, <i>Deus, "God."</i> A rationalist tradition dating back to English Lord Herbert of Cherbury (d. 1648), who defined the Five Articles of English Deists as: belief in a single supreme God; humanity's duty to revere God; linkage of worship with practical morality; that God will forgive us if we repent and abandon our sins; good works will be rewarded (and evil punished) both in life and after death. Deism rejects reliance on revealed religion, on religious authority and on the infallibility of scriptures such as the Bible and the Koran. Deism has no special places of worship, no priesthood and no heirachy of authority. Deism was greatly influential among politicians, scientists and philosophers during the later 17th century and 18th century in England, France, Germany and the United States. Many of America's founding fathers were Deists, including John Quincy Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison and George Washington. Deists were instrumental in creating the principle of separation of church and state, and the religious freedom clauses of the First Amendment. Source: www.religioustolerance.org/deism.  </p>

In one explanation of ancient India's caste system, strength -- mental, emotional and physical as well as spiritual -- is directly related to the frequency of orgasms. A <i>shudra</i> (laborer), releases his sexual energies daily and thus drains his brain. The <i>vaishya</i> (businessman) has sex weekly, as his energies are caught up in the mental activities of his business. The <i>kshatriya</i> (politician, defender of the country), engaged in statesmanship, martial arts, horsemanship, developing mind and body, expends his energies but monthly. The <i>brahmin</i> (priestly caste) has sexual union yearly, and only for the creation of a child. His energies are transmuted in his Sanskrit chanting, daily rituals and high-minded activities of all kind to uplift humanity. Thus, dissipation is on many levels and creates many kinds of people, according to the four levels of consciousness.  </p>

<p class="word-entry">evil</p>
<p class="definition">That which is bad, morally wrong, causing harm, pain, misery. In Western religions, evil is often thought of as a moral antagonism to God. This force is the source of sin and is attached to the soul from its inception. Whereas, for Hindus, evil is not a conscious, dark force, such as Satan. It is situational rather than ontological, meaning it has its basis in relative conditions, not in ultimate reality. Evil (wrong, corruption) springs from ignorance <i>(avidya)</i> and immaturity. Nor is one necessarily in conflict with God when one is evil; and God is not standing in final judgment. Within each soul, and not external to it, resides the principle of judgment of instinctive-intellectual actions. God, who is ever compassionate, blesses even the worst sinner, the most depraved <i>asura,</i> knowing that that individual will one day emerge from lower consciousness into the light of love and understanding. Hindus hold that evil, known in Sanskrit as <i>papa,</i> <i>papman</i> or <i>dushta,</i> is the result of unvirtuous acts <i>(papa</i> or <i>adharma</i>) caused by the instinctive-intellectual mind dominating and obscuring deeper, spiritual intelligence. (Note: both <i>papa</i> and <i>papman</i> are used as nouns and as adjectives.) The evil-doer is viewed as a young soul, ignorant of the value of right thought, speech and action, unable to live in the world without becoming entangled in <i>maya.</i> <b> -- intrinsic evil:  </b>Inherent, inborn badness. Some philosophies hold that man and the world are by nature imperfect, corrupt or evil. Hinduism holds, on the contrary, that there is no intrinsic evil, and the real nature of man is his divine, soul nature, which is goodness. </p>

<hr />
<p class="word-entry">evolution of the soul</p>
<p class="definition"><i>Adhyatma prasara.</i> In Saiva Siddhanta, the soul's evolution is a progressive unfoldment, growth and maturing toward its inherent, divine destiny, which is complete merger with Siva. In its essence, each soul is ever perfect. But as an individual soul body emanated by God Siva, it is like a small seed yet to develop. As an acorn needs to be planted in the dark underground to grow into a mighty oak tree, so must the soul unfold out of the darkness of the <i>malas</i> to full maturity and realization of its innate oneness with God. The soul is not created at the moment of conception of a physical body. Rather, it is created in the Sivaloka. It evolves by taking on denser and denser sheaths -- cognitive, instinctive-intellectual and <i>pranic</i> -- until finally it takes birth in physical form in the Bhuloka. Then it experiences many lives, maturing through the reincarnation process. Thus, from birth to birth, souls learn and mature. Evolution is the result of experience and the lessons derived from it. There are young souls just beginning to evolve, and old souls nearing the end of their earthly sojourn. In Saiva Siddhanta, evolution is understood as the removal of fetters which comes as a natural unfoldment, realization and expression of one's true, self-effulgent nature. This ripening or dropping away of the soul's bonds <i>(mala)</i> is called <i>malaparipakam.</i> The realization of the soul nature is termed <i>svanubhuti</i> (experience of the Self).  Self Realization leads to <i>moksha,</i> liberation from the three <i>malas</i> and the reincarnation cycles. Then evolution continues in the celestial worlds until the soul finally merges fully and indistinguishably into Supreme God Siva, the Primal Soul, Parameshvara. In his <i>Tirumantiram,</i> Rishi Tirumular calls this merger <i>vishvagrasa</i>, "total absorption." The evolution of the soul is not a linear progression, but an intricate, circular, many-faceted mystery. Nor is it at all encompassed in the Darwinian theory of evolution, which explains the origins of the human form as descended from earlier primates.  </p>

A moderate fast would involve avoiding heavier foods, or taking only juices, teas and other liquids.

The Hindu view acknowledges fate only in the limited sense that man is subject to his own past <i>karmas,</i> which are a driving force in each incarnation, seemingly out of his own control. But they can be mitigated by how he lives life, meaning how he faces and manages his <i>prarabdha</i> ("begun, undertaken") <i>karmas</i> and his <i>kriyamana</i> ("being made") <i>karmas.</i>  </p>

<p class="definition"><i>Pancha kutumba sadhana,</i> or five parenting guidelines. 1) <b>Good Conduct -- Dharmachara:</b> Loving fathers and mothers, knowing they are the greatest influence in a child's life, behave the way their dear children should when adults. They never anger or argue before young ones. Father in a <i>dhoti,</i> mother in a <i>sari</i> at home, all sing to God, Gods and <i>guru.</i> 2) <b>Home Worship -- Dharma Svagriha:</b> Loving fathers and mothers establish a separate shrine room in the home for God, Gods and guardian <i>devas</i> of the family. Ideally it should be large enough for all the dear children. It is a sacred place for scriptural study, a refuge from the karmic storms of life.3) <b>Talking About Religion -- Dharma Sambhashana:</b> Loving fathers and mothers speak Vedic precepts while driving, eating and playing. This helps dear children understand experiences in right perspective. Parents know many worldly voices are blaring, and their <i>dharmic</i> voice must be stronger. 4) <b>Continuing Self-Study -- Dharma Svadhyaya:</b> Loving fathers and mothers keep informed by studying the <i>Vedas</i>, <i>Agamas</i> and sacred literature, listening to <i>swamis</i> and <i>pandits</i>. Youth face a world they will one day own, thus parents prepare their dear children to guide their own future progeny. 5) <b>Following a Spiritual Preceptor -- Dharma Sanga:</b> Loving fathers and mothers choose a preceptor, a traditional satguru, and lineage to follow. They support their lineage with all their heart, energy and service. He in turn provides them clear guidance for a successful life, material and religious. </p>

To show the Divine's transcendence of sexuality, sometimes God is shown as having qualities of both sexes, e.g., Ardhanarishvara, "Half-woman God;" or Lord Nataraja, who wears a feminine earring in one ear and a masculine one in the other.  </p>

<p class="definition">Mahadevas, "great beings of light." In <i>Dancing with Siva,</i> the plural form of <i>God</i> refers to extremely advanced beings existing in their self-effulgent soul bodies in the causal plane -- the Sivaloka. The meaning of <i>Gods</i> is best seen in the phrase, "God and the Gods," referring to the Supreme God -- Siva -- and the Mahadevas who are His creation. Originally created by Siva, as all souls are, Gods have evolved to a constant superconsciousness as they govern, advance and assist all worlds. Gods are genderless, neither male nor female, but pure kundalini-energy beings.   </p>

<p class="word-entry">grace</p>
<p class="definition">"Benevolence, love, giving," from the Latin <i>gratia,</i> "favor," "goodwill." God's power of revealment, <i>anugraha shakti</i> ("kindness, showing favor"), by which souls are awakened to their true, Divine nature. Grace in the unripe stages of the spiritual journey is experienced by the devotee as receiving gifts or boons, often unbidden, from God. The mature soul finds himself surrounded by grace. He sees all of God's actions as grace, whether they be seemingly pleasant and helpful or not. For him, his very love of God, the power to meditate or worship, and the spiritual urge which drives his life are entirely and obviously God's grace, a divine endowment, an intercession, unrelated to any deed or action he did or could perform.  In Saiva Siddhanta, it is grace that awakens the love of God within the devotee, softens the intellect and inaugurates the quest for Self Realization. It descends when the soul has reached a certain level of maturity, and often comes in the form of a spiritual initiation, called <i>shaktipata,</i> from a <i>satguru.</i> Grace is not only the force of illumination or revealment. It also includes Siva's other four powers -- creation, preservation, destruction and concealment -- through which He provides the world of experience and limits the soul's consciousness so that it may evolve. More broadly, grace is God's ever-flowing love and compassion, <i>karunya</i>, also known as <i>kripa</i> ("tenderness, compassion") and <i>prasada</i> (literally, "clearness, purity").  To whom is God's grace given? Can it be earned? Two famous analogies, that of the monkey <i>(markata)</i> and that of the cat <i>(marjara)</i> express two classical viewpoints on salvation and grace. The <i>markata</i> school, perhaps represented more fully by the <i>Vedas,</i> asserts that the soul must cling to God like a monkey clings to its mother and thus participate in its "salvation." The <i>marjara</i> school, which better reflects the position of the <i>Agamas,</i> says that the soul must be like a young kitten, totally dependent on its mother's will, picked up in her mouth by the scruff of the neck and carried here and there. This crucial state of loving surrender is called <i>prapatti.</i>  </p>

<p class="word-entry"><i>grihastha dharma</i></p>
<p class="definition">"Householder law." The virtues and ideals of family life. This <i>dharma</i> includes all nonmonastics, whether married or single. In general, <i>grihastha dharma</i> begins with the completion of the period of studentship and extends throughout the period of raising a family (called the <i>grihastha ashrama)</i>. Specific scriptures, called <i>Dharma Shastras</i> and <i>Grihya Shastras,</i> outline the duties and obligations of family life. In Hinduism, family life is one of serving, learning and striving within a close-knit community of many relatives forming a joint family and its broader connections as an extended family under the aegis of a spiritual <i>guru.</i> Each is expected to work harmoniously to further the wealth and happiness of the family and the society, to practice religious disciplines and raise children of strong moral fiber to carry on the tradition. Life is called a <i>jivayajna,</i> "self-sacrifice," for each incarnation is understood as an opportunity for spiritual advancement through fulfilling one's <i>dharma</i> of birth, which is the pattern one chose before entering this world, a pattern considered by many as bestowed by God. In the majority of cases, sons follow in the footsteps of their father, and daughters in those of their mother. All interrelate with love and kindness. Respect for all older than oneself is a keynote. Marriages are arranged and the culture is maintained.  The householder strives to fulfill the four <i>purusharthas,</i> "human goals" of righteousness, wealth, pleasure and liberation. While taking care of one's own family is most central, it is only part of this <i>dharma's</i> expectations. <i>Grihasthas</i> must support the religion by building and maintaining temples, monasteries and other religious institutions, supporting the monastics and disseminating the teachings. They must care for the elderly and feed the poor and homeless. Of course, the duties of husband and wife are different. The <i>Tirukural</i> describes the householder's central duties as serving these five: ancestors, God, guests, kindred and himself. The <i>Dharma Shastras,</i> similarly, enjoin daily offerings to <i>rishis,</i> ancestors, Gods, creatures and men.  </p>

They correspond to the <i>pingala</i> and <i>ida</i> <i>nadis</i>--mental and emotional currents--flowing up, in a crisscross pattern, the sides of the <i>kundalini nadi: sushumna.</i> Through breath control--<i>ha</i> is inbreath, <i>tha</i> is outbreath--and the manipulation of the physical/astral bodies through specific series of <i>asanas</i> (postures) and <i>mudras</i> (bodily positions), the <i>ida</i> and <i>pingala</i> currents are perfectly balanced and the <i>yogi</i> functions in his <i>sushumna (kundalini) nadi</i>. The <i>yogi</i> is then prepared for deep meditation, following <i>raja yoga,</i> or <i>kundalini yoga</i> under the guidance of a <i>guru.</i> Besides its spiritual benefits, <i>hatha yoga</i> results in purification of the subconscious mind and robust physiological health contributing towards longevity. <i>Hatha yoga</i> is an ancient Natha Sampradaya science--its first historical appearance being on the famous Pasupati seal from the 6,000 year-old Indus Valley empire. <i>Hatha yoga</i> is propounded in the <i>Saiva Agamas,</i> Tirumular's <i>Tirumantiram</i> and Patanjali's <i>Yoga Sutras</i>.

<p class="word-entry"><i>hatha yoga</i></p>
<p class="definition">"Forceful yoga." <i>Hatha yoga</i> is a system of physical and mental exercise developed in ancient times as a means of rejuvenation by <i>rishis</i> and <i>tapasvins</i> who meditated for long hours, and used today in preparing the body and mind for meditation. Its elements are 1) postures <i>(asana),</i> 2) cleansing practices <i>(dhauti</i> or <i>shodhana)</i>, 3)breath control <i>(pranayama),</i> 4) locks <i>(bandha,</i> which temporarily restrict local flows of <i>prana)</i> and 5) hand gestures <i>(mudra),</i> all of which regulate the flow of <i>prana</i> and purify the inner and outer bodies. <i>Hatha yoga</i> is broadly practiced in many traditions. It is the third limb <i>(anga)</i> of Patanjali's <i>raja yoga.</i> It is integral to the Saiva and Shakta <i>tantra</i> traditions, and part of modern <i>ayurveda</i> treatment. In the West, <i>hatha yoga</i> has been superficially adopted as a health-promoting, limbering, stress-reducing form of exercise, often included in aerobic routines. Esoterically, <i>ha</i> and <i>tha, </i>respectively, indicate the microcosmic sun <i>(ha)</i> and moon <i>(tha)</i>, which symbolize the masculine current, <i>pingala nadi,</i> and feminine current, <i>ida nadi</i>, in the human body.

<p class="word-entry">Hindu</p>
<p class="definition">A follower of, or relating to, Hinduism. Generally, one is understood to be a Hindu by being born into a Hindu family and practicing the faith, or by professing oneself a Hindu. Acceptance into the fold is recognized through the name-giving sacrament, a temple ceremony called <i>namakarana samskara,</i> given to born Hindus shortly after birth, and to Hindus by choice who have proven their sincerity and been accepted by a Hindu community. Full conversion is completed through disavowal of previous religious affiliations and legal change of name. While traditions vary greatly, all Hindus rely on the <i>Vedas</i> as scriptural authority and generally attest to the following nine principles: 1) There exists a one, all-pervasive Supreme Being who is both immanent and transcendent, both creator and unmanifest Reality. 2) The universe undergoes endless cycles of creation, preservation and dissolution. 3) All souls are evolving toward God and will ultimately find <i>moksha:</i> spiritual knowledge and liberation from the cycle of rebirth. Not a single soul will be eternally deprived of this destiny. 4) <i>Karma</i> is the law of cause and effect by which each individual creates his own destiny by his thoughts, words and deeds. 5) The soul reincarnates, evolving through many births until all <i>karmas</i> have been resolved. 6) Divine beings exist in unseen worlds, and temple worship, rituals, sacraments, as well as personal devotionals, create a communion with these <i>devas</i> and Gods. 7) A spiritually awakened master or <i>satguru</i> is essential to know the transcendent Absolute, as are personal discipline, good conduct, purification, self-inquiry and meditation. 8) All life is sacred, to be loved and revered, and therefore one should practice <i>ahimsa,</i> nonviolence. 9) No particular religion teaches the only and exclusive way to salvation above all others. Rather, all genuine religious paths are facets of God's pure love and light, deserving tolerance and understanding. </p>

The most ancient religion in the world; the only religion not founded by man. Encompasses a broad spectrum of religious philosophies ranging from pluralistic theism to absolute monism. There are three main sects: Saivism, Vaishnavism, Saktism--and liberal, non-sectarian forms, such as the Smarta Sampradaya.   </p>

<hr />
<p class="word-entry">Hinduism (Hindu Dharma)</p>
<p class="definition">India's indigenous religious and cultural system, followed today by nearly one billion adherents, mostly in India, but with the large diaspora in many other countries. Also called Sanatana Dharma, "Eternal Religion" and Vaidika Dharma, "Religion of the <i>Vedas</i>." Hinduism is the world's most ancient religion and encompasses a broad spectrum of philosophies ranging from pluralistic theism to absolute monism. It is a family of myriad faiths with four primary denominations: Saivism, Vaishnavism, Shaktism and Smartism. These four hold such divergent beliefs that each is a complete and independent religion. Yet, they share a vast heritage of culture and belief -- <i>karma, dharma,</i> reincarnation, all-pervasive Divinity, temple worship, sacraments, manifold Deities, the <i>guru-shishya</i> tradition and a reliance on the <i>Vedas</i> as scriptural authority. From the rich soil of Hinduism long ago sprang various other traditions. Among these were Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism, which rejected the <i>Vedas</i> and thus emerged as completely distinct religions, dissociated from Hinduism, while still sharing many philosophical insights and cultural values with their parent faith. Though the genesis of the term is controversial, the consensus is that the term <i>Hindu</i> or <i>Indu</i> was used by the Persians to refer to the inhabitants of the Indus Valley as early as 500 BCE. Additionally, Indian scholars point to the appearance of the related term <i>Sindhu</i> in the ancient <i>Rig Veda Samhita.</i> Janaki Abhisheki writes <i>(Religion as Knowledge: The Hindu Concept,</i> p. 1): "Whereas today the word <i>Hindu</i> connotes a particular faith and culture, in ancient times it was used to describe those belonging to a particular region. About 500 BCE we find the Persians referring to 'Hapta Hindu.' This referred to the region of Northwest India and the Punjab (before partition). The <i>Rig Veda</i> (the most ancient scripture of the Hindus) uses the word <i>Sapta Sindhu</i> singly or in plural at least 200 times. Sindhu is the River Indus. Panini, the great Sanskrit grammarian, also uses the word <i>Sindhu</i> to denote the country or region." While the Persians substituted <i>h</i> for <i>s</i>, the Greeks ignored the <i>h</i> and pronounced the word as 'India' for the country and 'Indoi' for the people. Dr. S. Radhakrishnan similarly observed, "The Hindu civilization is so called since its original founders or earliest followers occupied the territory drained by the Sindhu River system corresponding to the Northwest Frontier Province and the Punjab. This is recorded in the <i>Rig Veda,</i> the oldest of the <i>Vedas,</i> the Hindu scriptures, which give their name to this period of Indian history. The people on the Indian side of the Sindhu were called Hindus by the Persians and the later Western invaders. That is the genesis of the word <i>Hindu" (The Hindu View of Life,</i> p. 12).  </p>

<p class="word-entry">hosting guests</p>
<p class="definition">Hospitality toward special guests in Hindu homes is extraordinary. It follows the Vedic edict that the guest is God in one of many forms. Therefore, greetings and hospitality are offered as if to a God.  While each visitor, whether close or distant, is treated with love and generosity, a protocol is observed on special occasions for honored guests in the South Indian/Sri Lankan Hindu tradition. The house is decorated with <i>tombais</i> (ornaments made from palm leaves) and mango leaves above the front door. Outside the front door on the porch are set a <i>kuttuvilaku</i> (standing oil lamp) and <i>kumbha</i> (water pot with five mango leaves and a decorated coconut, representing Lord Ganesha). <i>Kolams</i> (floor decorations made from colored rice flour) are drawn at the threshold or gate of the home.   Guests are greeted at the door with offerings of <i>vibhuti, kunkuma</i> and <i>chandana,</i> then sprinkled lightly with rose water and given a small candy. They then enter the home and are led into the shrine room where the elder man of the house performs <i>arati</i> to Ganesha, Murugan and Siva. Following the <i>arati,</i> everyone goes into the communal room of the house and arranges themselves in a <i>chakravala,</i> or a circle according to age, first the men, then the ladies, each younger sitting to his or her elder's left. The most senior male leads everyone in a peaceful invocation, then <i>bhajanas</i> are led and sung by all. Other activities follow.   For meals, mats are laid on the floor in two lines, one side for men and another for ladies. Banana leaves are placed before each person, sometimes on top of plates. The lady of the house and the youngest women serve everyone. Salt is first placed at the top right corner of each leaf, followed by the curries and rice with <i>sambar.</i> Seconds are offered until everyone is satisfied. After the initial rice with <i>sambar,</i> rice is served with <i>rasam</i> and then with curd, or yogurt, as well as more salt, if necessary, and pickles. Tumblers of water and <i>rasam</i> are available for each guest (although usually water only is served nowadays). <i>Kesari, payasam</i> or other sweets and tea are served after the meal. When the meal is concluded, very special guests would be offered a bowl of water to wash their hands where they sit. Hands are never washed in the kitchen sink, but the bathroom is okay. In Asia a special sink is most often located in the room where meals are taken. The hostess, standing and facing East, gives each married lady <i>kunkuma</i> and all guests a gift upon their departure, often as simple as a few betel leaves or a candy. Friends, relatives and casual guests are treated according to a more informal protocol.  </p>

<p class="word-entry"><i>jati</i></p>
<p class="definition">"Birth; position assigned by birth; rank, caste, family, race, lineage." <i>Jati,</i> more than <i>varna,</i> is the specific determinant of one's social community. Traditionally, because of rules of purity each <i>jati</i> is excluded from social interaction with the others, especially from interdining and intermarriage. In modern times there is also a large group (one-seventh of India's population in 1981) outside the four <i>varnas.</i> These are called scheduled classes, untouchables, <i>jatihita</i> ("outcaste"), <i>chandalas</i> (specifically those who handle corpses) and <i>harijan,</i> a name given by Mahatma Gandhi, meaning "children of God." "Untouchable" <i>jatis</i> included the <i>nishada</i> (hunter), <i>kaivarta</i> (fisherman) and <i>karavara</i> (leather worker). The <i>varna dharma</i> system -- despite its widespread discrimination against <i>harijans,</i> and the abuse of social status by higher castes -- ensures a high standard of craftsmanship, a sense of community belonging, family integrity and religio-cultural continuity. Caste is not unique to Hinduism and India. By other names it is found in every society. The four <i>varnas,</i> or classes, and myriad <i>jatis,</i> occupational castes, or guilds, form the basic elements of human interaction. </p>

(Contrasted with <i>videhamukta,</i> one liberated at the point of death.) This attainment is the culmination of lifetimes of intense striving, <i>sadhana</i> and <i>tapas,</i> requiring total renunciation, <i>sannyasa</i> (death to the external world, denoted in the conducting of one's own funeral rites), in the current incarnation. While completing life in the physical body, the <i>jivanmukta</i> enjoys the ability to reenter <i>nirvikalpa samadhi</i> again and again. At this time, <i>siddhis</i> can be developed which are carried to the inner worlds after <i>mahasamadhi</i>. Such an awakened <i>jnani</i> benefits the society by simply being who he is. When he speaks, he does so without forethought. His wisdom is beyond reason, yet it does not conflict with reason. Nor does he arrive at what he says through the process of reason, but through the process of <i>ajna-chakra</i> sight.  </p>

The repeated <i>samadhis</i> of Parashiva ever deepen this flow of divine knowing which establishes the knower in an extraordinary point of reference, totally different from those who have not attained this enlightenment. <i>Jnana</i> is the awakened, superconscious state <i>(karana chitta)</i> working within the ordinary experience of the world, flowing into daily life situations. It is the fruition of the progressive stages of <i>charya, kriya</i> and <i>yoga</i> in the Saiva Siddhanta system of spiritual unfoldment. <i>Jnana</i> is sometimes misunderstood as book knowledge, as a maturity or awakening that comes from simply understanding a complex philosophical system or systems. Those who define <i>jnana</i> in this way deny that the path is a progression of <i>charya-kriya-yoga-jnana</i> or of <i>karma-bhakti-raja-jnana.</i> Rather, they say that one can choose his path, and that each leads to the ultimate goal.  </p>

<p class="definition"><i>Kutumba</i> or <i>kula.</i> The Hindu social unit consisting of several generations of kindred living together under the same roof or in a joining compound. Traditionally, joint families live in a large single home, but in modern times accommodations are often in individual, nuclear homes within a shared compound. The joint family includes the father and mother, sons, grandsons and great-grandsons with their spouses, as well as the daughters, granddaughters and great-granddaughters until they are married -- thus often comprising several married couples and their children. The head of the joint family, called <i>kutumba mukhya</i> (also <i>mukhya</i> or <i>kartri),</i> is the father, supported by the mother, and in his absence, the elder son, guided by his mother and supported by his spouse. From an early age, the eldest son is given special training by his father to assume this future responsibility as head of the family. In the event of the father's death, sacred law does allow for the splitting of the family wealth between the sons. Division of family assets may also be necessary in cases where sons are involved in different professions and live in different places, with an inability for all to get along under one roof, or when the family becomes unmanageably large.  The main characteristics of the joint family are that its members 1) share a common residence, 2) partake of food prepared in the same kitchen, 3) hold their property in common and, 4) ideally, profess the same religion, sect and <i>sampradaya.</i> Each individual family of husband, wife and children is under the guidance of the head of the joint family. All work together unselfishly to further the common good. Each joint family extends out from its home to include a second level of connections as an "extended family" <i>(brihatkutumba</i> or <i>mahakutumba).</i>  </p>

<p class="definition">A spiritual lineage of 162 <i>siddhas</i>, a major stream of the Nandinatha Sampradaya, proponents of the ancient philosophy of monistic Saiva Siddhanta. The first of these masters that history recalls was Maharishi Nandinatha (or Nandikesvara) 2,250 years ago, <i>satguru</i> to the great Tirumular, ca 200 BCE, and seven other disciples (as stated in the <i>Tirumantiram):</i> Patanjali, Vyaghrapada, Sanatkumara, Sivayogamuni, Sanakar, Sanadanar and Sananthanar. Tirumular had seven disciples: Malangam, Indiran, Soman, Brahman, Rudran, Kalanga, and Kanjamalayam, each of whom established one or more monasteries and propagated the Agamic lore. In the line of Kalanga came the sages Righama, Maligaideva, Nadantar, Bhogadeva and Paramananda. The lineage continued down the centuries and is alive today -- the first recent <i>siddha</i> known being the "Rishi from the Himalayas," so named because he descended from those holy mountains. In South India, he initiated Kadaitswami (ca 1810 -- 1875), who in turn initiated Chellappaswami(1840 -- 1915). Chellappan passed the mantle of authority to Sage Yogaswami (1872 -- 1964), who in 1949 initiated Sivaya Subramuniyaswami (1927 -- 2001), who in 2001 ordained the current preceptor, Satguru Bodhinatha (1942 -- ).  </p>

<p class="word-entry"><i>karma</i></p>
<p class="definition">"Action," "deed." One of the most important principles in Hindu thought, <i>karma</i> refers to 1) any act or deed; 2) the principle of cause and effect; 3) a consequence or <i>"</i>fruit of action" <i>(karmaphala)</i> or "after effect" <i>(uttaraphala),</i> which sooner or later returns upon the doer. What we sow, we shall reap in this or future lives. Selfish, hateful acts <i>(papakarma</i> or <i>kukarma)</i> will bring suffering. Benevolent actions <i>(punyakarma</i> or <i>sukarma)</i> will bring loving reactions. <i>Karma</i> is a neutral, self-perpetuating law of the inner cosmos, much as gravity is an impersonal law of the outer cosmos. In fact, it has been said that gravity is a small, external expression of the greater law of <i>karma</i>. The impelling, unseen power of one's past actions is called <i>adrishta</i>.  The law of <i>karma</i> acts impersonally, yet we may meaningfully interpret its results as either positive <i>(punya)</i> or negative <i>(papa)</i> -- terms describing actions leading the soul either toward or away from the spiritual goal. <i>Karma</i> is further graded as: white (<i>shukla),</i> black <i>(krishna),</i> mixed <i>(shukla-krishna)</i> or neither white nor black <i>(ashukla-akrishna)</i>. The latter term describes the <i>karma</i> of the <i>jnani,</i> who, as Rishi Patanjali says, is established in <i>kaivalya,</i> freedom from <i>prakriti</i> through realization of the Self. Similarly, one's <i>karma</i> must be in a condition of <i>ashukla-akrishna,</i> quiescent balance, in order for liberation to be attained. This equivalence of <i>karma</i> is called <i>karmasamya</i>, and is a factor that brings <i>malaparipakam,</i> or maturity of <i>anava mala</i>. It is this state of resolution in preparation for <i>samadhi</i> at death that all Hindus seek through making amends and settling differences.   <i>Karma</i> is threefold: <i>sanchita, prarabdha</i> and <i>kriyamana</i>. -- sanchita karma: </p>

<p class="word-entry">Kashmir Saivism</p>
<p class="definition">In this mildly theistic and intensely monistic school founded by Vasugupta around 850, Siva is immanent and transcendent. Purification and <i>yoga</i> are strongly emphasized. Kashmir Saivism provides an extremely rich and detailed understanding of the human psyche, and a clear and distinct path of <i>kundalini-siddha</i> <i>yoga</i> to the goal of Self Realization. The Kashmir Saivite is not so much concerned with worshiping a personal God as he is with attaining the transcendental state of Siva consciousness. <i>Sadhana</i> leads to the assimilation of the object (world) in the subject (I) until the Self (Siva) stands revealed as one with the universe. The goal -- liberation -- is sustained recognition <i>(pratyabhijna</i>) of one's true Self as nothing but Siva. There are three <i>upaya,</i> or stages of attainment of God consciousness: <i>anavopaya (yoga), shaktopaya</i> (spiritual discrimination), <i>shambhavopaya</i> (attainment through the guru's instruction) and <i>anupaya,</i> or "no means" (spontaneous realization without effort). Kashmir Saivite literature is in three broad divisions: <i>Agama Shastras, Spanda Shastras</i> and <i>Pratyabhijna Shastras.</i> Today various organizations promulgate the esoteric teachings. While the number of Kashmir Saivite formal followers is uncertain, the school remains an important influence in India.  </p>

<p class="word-entry"><i>maya</i></p>
<p class="definition">"She who measures;" or "mirific energy." The substance emanated from Siva through which the world of form is manifested. Hence all creation is also termed <i>maya.</i> It is the cosmic creative force, the principle of manifestation, ever in the process of creation, preservation and dissolution. <i>Maya</i> is a key concept in Hinduism, originally meaning "supernatural power; God's mirific energy," often translated as "illusion." The <i>Upanishads</i> underscore <i>maya's</i> captivating nature, which blinds souls to the transcendent Truth. In Adi Sankara's Vedantic interpretation, <i>maya</i> is taken as pure illusion or unreality. In Saivism it is one of the three bonds <i>(pasha)</i> that limit the soul and thereby facilitate its evolution. For Saivites and most other nondualists, it is understood not as illusion but as relative reality, in contrast to the unchanging Absolute Reality. In the Saiva Siddhanta system, there are three main divisions of <i>maya,</i> the pure, the pure-impure and the impure realms. Pure or <i>shuddha maya</i> consists of the first five <i>tattvas</i> -- Siva <i>tattva,</i> Shakti <i>tattva,</i> Sadashiva <i>tattva,</i> Ishvara <i>tattva</i> and Shuddhavidya <i>tattva.</i> The pure-impure realm consists of the next seven <i>tattvas.</i> The impure realm consists of the <i>maya tattva</i> and all of its evolutes -- from the <i>kala tattva</i> to <i>prithivi,</i> the element earth. Thus, in relation to the physical universe, <i>maya</i> is the principle of ever-changing matter. In Vaishnavism, <i>maya</i> is one of the nine Shaktis of Vishnu.  </p>

At such sites, chemicals are usually airborne in life-threatening quantities. They contaminate clothing, especially footwear, and often cause spontaneous explosions.  </p>

In Hindu cosmology, the outer world is a macrocosm of the inner world, which is its microcosm and is mystically larger and more complex than the physical universe and functions at a higher rate of vibration and even a different rate of time. The microcosm precedes the macrocosm. Thus, the guiding principle of the Bhuloka comes from the Antarloka and Sivaloka. Consciousness precedes physical form. In the <i>tantric</i> tradition, the body of man is viewed as a microcosm of the entire divine creation. "Microcosm-macrocosm" is embodied in the terms <i>pinda</i> and <i>anda</i>.  </p>

<p class="word-entry">mind (five states)</p>
<p class="definition">A view of the mind in five parts. <b>-- conscious mind (</b><i>Jagrat chitta, </i>"wakeful consciousness"): The ordinary, waking, thinking state of mind in which the majority of people function most of the day. <b>-- subconscious mind (</b><i>Samskara chitta, </i>"impression mind"): The part of mind "beneath" the conscious mind, the storehouse or recorder of all experience (whether remembered consciously or not) -- the holder of past impressions, reactions and desires. Also, the seat of involuntary physiological processes. <b>-- subsubconscious mind (</b><i>Vasana chitta,</i>"mind of subliminal traits"): The area of the subconscious mind formed when two thoughts or experiences of the same rate of intensity are sent into the subconscious at different times and,intermingling, give rise to a new and totally different rate of vibration. This subconscious formation later causes the external mind to react to situations according to these accumulated vibrations, be they positive, negative or mixed. <b>--superconscious mind</b> <i>(Karana chitta):</i> The mind of light, the all-knowing intelligence of the soul. At its deepest level, the superconscious is Parashakti, or Satchidananda, the Divine Mind of God Siva. <b>-- subsuperconscious mind</b> <i>(Anukaranachitta):</i> The superconscious mind working through the conscious and subconscious states, which brings forth intuition, clarity and insight.  </p>

<p class="word-entry">mind (individual)</p>
<p class="definition">At the microcosmic level of individual souls, mind is consciousness and its faculties of memory, desire, thought and cognition. Individual mind is <i>chitta</i> (mind, consciousness) and its threefold expression is called <i>antahkarana,</i> "inner faculty" composed of: 1) <i>buddhi</i> ("intellect, reason, logic," higher mind); 2) <i>ahamkara</i> ("I-maker," egoity); 3) <i>manas</i> ("lower mind," instinctive-intellectual mind, the seat of desire). From the perspective of the 36 <i>tattvas</i> (categories of existence), each of these is a <i>tattva</i> which evolves out of the one before it. Thus, from <i>buddhi</i> comes <i>ahamkara</i> and then <i>manas.</i> <i>Manas</i>, <i>buddhi</i> and <i>ahamkara</i> are faculties of the <i>manomaya kosha</i> (astral or instinctive-intellectual sheath). <i>Anukarana chitta,</i> subsuperconsciousness, the knowing mind, is the mind state of the <i>vijnanamaya kosha</i> (mental or intuitive-cognitive sheath). The aspect of mind corresponding directly to the <i>anandamaya kosha</i> (causal body) is <i>karana chitta,</i> superconsciousness.  </p>

In monasteries, dedicated to transmutation of the sexual energies, celibacy is strictly upheld and there is no fraternizing with the opposite sex. The purpose of the monastery is to create an environment in which the monastic can balance the male and female energies <i>(pingala</i> and <i>ida)</i> within himself so that he lives in the spiritual, or <i>sushumna</i>, energy, which cannot be maintained in close association with the opposite sex. The monastic, whether a monk or a nun, is, in a sense, neither male nor female, but a pure soul being.  </p>

Theism is the belief that God exists as a real, conscious, personal Supreme Being. Monistic theism is the dipolar doctrine, also called panentheism, that embraces both monism and theism, two perspectives ordinarily considered contradictory or mutually exclusive, since theism implies dualism. Monistic theism simultaneously accepts that God has a personal form, that He creates, pervades and <i>is</i> all that exists -- and that He ultimately transcends all existence and that the soul is, in essence, one with God. Advaita Siddhanta (monistic Saiva Siddhanta, or Advaita Ishvaravada Saiva Siddhanta) is a specific form of monistic theism.  </p>

Through the practice of <i>yoga,</i> the control and transmutation of the masculine and feminine forces within himself, the monk is a complete being, free to follow the contemplative and mystic life toward realization of the Self within. Benevolent and strong, courageous, fearless, not entangled in the thoughts and feelings of others, monks are affectionately detached from society, defenders of the faith, kind, loving and ever-flowing with timely wisdom.

<p class="word-entry">monotheism</p>
<p class="definition">"Doctrine of one God." Contrasted with polytheism, meaning belief in many Gods. The term <i>monotheism</i> covers a wide range of philosophical positions, from exclusive (or pure) monotheism, which recognizes only one God (such as in Semitic faiths), to inclusive monotheism, which also accepts the existence of other Gods. Generally speaking, the sects of Hinduism are inclusively monotheistic in their belief in a one Supreme God, and in their reverence for other Gods, or Mahadevas. However, such terms which arose out of Western philosophy do not really describe the fullness of Hindu thinking. Realizing this, Raimundo Panikkar, author of <i>The Vedic Experience,</i> offered a new word: <i>cosmotheandrism,</i> "world-God-man doctrine," to describe a philosophy that views God, soul and world (Pati, <i>pashu,</i> <i>pasha)</i> as an integrated, inseparable unity.  </p>

Naraka is a congested, distressful area where demonic beings and young souls may sojourn until they resolve the darksome <i>karmas</i> they have created. Here beings suffer the consequences of their own misdeeds in previous lives. Naraka is understood as having seven regions, called <i>tala,</i> corresponding to the states of consciousness of the seven lower <i>chakras</i> as follows: 1) Put, "childless" -- <i>atala chakra,</i> "wheel of the bottomless region." Fear and lust (located in the hips). 2) Avichi, "joyless" -- <i>vitala chakra:</i> "wheel of negative region." Center of anger (thighs). 3) Samhata, "abandoned" -- <i>sutala chakra:</i> "Great depth."

The intensity of "hell" begins at this deep level. 7) Kakola, "black poison" <i>-- patala</i> <i>chakra,</i> "wheel of the fallen or sinful level." Region of malice (soles of the feet). The sevenfold hellish region in its entirety is also called <i>patala,</i> "fallen region." Scriptures offer other lists of hells, numbering 7 or 21.

<p class="word-entry">Nataraja</p>
<p class="definition">"King of Dance, or King of Dancers." God as the Cosmic Dancer. Perhaps Hinduism's richest and most eloquent symbol, Nataraja represents Siva, the Primal Soul, Parameshvara, as the power, energy and life of all that exists. This is Siva's intricate state of Being in Manifestation. The dance of Siva as Natesha, Lord of Dancers, is the dance of the entire cosmos, the rhythmic movements in all. All that is, whether sentient or insentient, pulsates in His body. Nataraja is art and spirituality in perfect oneness, chosen to depict the Divine because in dance that which is created is inseparable from its creator, just as the universe and soul cannot be separated from God. Nataraja is also stillness and motion wrought together. The stillness speaks of the peace and poise that lies within us all, at the center. The intense motion, depicted by His hair flying wildly in all directions, is an intimation of the fury and ferocity, the violent vigor, which fills this universe wherein we dwell. The implication of these opposites is that God contains and allows them both, that there is divine purpose at work in our life, whether we find ourselves engaged in its beauty or its "madness." Dance and dancer are one; not an atom moves on any plane of existence but by His Will. Thus, this elegant symbol embodies the underlying unity of all. Siva's Dance, or all that happens, is composed of an ever-flowing combination of His five potent actions, <i>panchakritya:</i> 1) srishti: creation, or emanation, represented by His upper right hand and the <i>damaru</i> (drum), upon which he beats Paranada, the Primal Sound from which issue forth the rhythms and cycles of creation; 2) sthiti: preservation, represented by His lower right hand in a gesture of blessing, <i>abhaya mudra,</i> saying "fear not;" 3) samhara: destruction, dissolution or absorption, represented by the fire in His upper left hand, posed in <i>ardhachandra mudra,</i> "half-moon gesture;" 4) tirobhava: obscuring grace, the power which hides the truth, thereby permitting experience, growth and eventual fulfillment of destiny, represented by His right foot upon the prostrate figure (Apasmarapurusha), the principle of ignorance, or <i>anava</i>; 5) anugraha: revealing grace -- which grants knowledge and severs the soul's bonds -- represented by Siva's raised left foot, and by His lower left hand, held in <i>gajahasta</i> ("elephant trunk") <i>mudra,</i> inviting approach. These five cosmic activities are sometimes personalized respectively as Brahma, Vishnu, Rudra, Maheshvara and Sadashiva -- or as Sadyojata (creation), Vamadeva (preservation), Aghora (reabsorption), Tatpurusha (obscuration) and Ishana (granting grace). The ring of fire <i>(prabhamandala),</i> in which Siva dances is the hall of consciousness, <i>chitsabha;</i> in other words, the light-filled heart of man, the central chamber of the manifest cosmos. Siva dances the universe into and out of existence, veiling Ultimate Reality for most, unveiling it for devotees who draw near and recognize Parashiva, Ultimate Reality, in the chamber of their own inner being. Yea, all are dancing with Siva. </p>

<p class="definition"><i>Navabharata Dharma.</i> A modern form of liberal Hinduism that carries forward basic Hindu cultural values -- such as dress, diet and the arts -- while allowing religious values to subside. It emerged after the British Raj, when India declared itself an independent, secular state. It was promoted by the Macaulay educational system, installed in India by the British, which aggressively undermined Hindu thought and belief. Neo-Indian religion encourages Hindus to follow any combination of theological, scriptural, <i>sadhana</i> and worship patterns, regardless of sectarian or religious origin.

There are ten <i>yamas</i> and ten <i>niyamas</i> in all, though Patanjali listed only five <i>yamas</i> and five <i>niyamas</i> in his classic work, &amp; these have become widely known. Along with the <i>yamas</i> (restraints), the <i>niyamas</i> provide guidelines for ethical, moral life and lay the foundation for <i>yoga</i>. The ten <i>niyamas</i> are: 1) <i>santosha</i> (contentment), 2) <i>tapaha</i> (austerity), 3) <i>dana</i> (charity), 4) <i>astikya</i> (faith), 5) Isvarapujana (worship), 6) <i>mati</i> (cognition), 7) Siddhantasravana<i> </i>(scriptural study), 8) <i>hri</i> (remorse), 9) <i>vrata</i> (sacred vows) and 10) <i>japa</i> (recitation).

<p class="word-entry">nonhuman birth</p>
<p class="definition">The phenomenon of the soul being born as nonhuman life forms, explained in various scriptures. For example, Saint Manikkavasagar's famous hymn <i>(Tiruvasagam</i> 8.14): "I became grass and herbs, worm and tree. I became many beasts, bird and snake. I became stone and man, goblins and sundry celestials. I became mighty demons, silent sages and the Gods. Taken form in life, moveable and immovable, born in all, I am weary of birth, my Great Lord." The <i>Upanishads,</i> too, describe the soul's course after death and later taking a higher or lower birth according to its merit or demerit of the last life <i>(Kaushitaki Upanishad</i> 1.2<i>, Chhandogya Upanishad</i> 5.3 -- 5.10<i>, Brihadaranyaka Upanishad</i> 6.2). These statements are sometimes misunderstood to mean that each soul must slowly, in sequential order incarnate as successively higher beings, beginning with the lowest organism, to finally obtain a human birth. In fact, as the <i>Upanishads</i> explain, after death the soul, reaching the inner worlds, reaps the harvest of its deeds, is tested and then takes on the appropriate incarnation -- be it human or nonhuman -- according to its merit or demerit. Souls destined for human evolution are human-like from the moment of their creation in the Sivaloka. This is given outer expression in the Antarloka and Bhuloka, on Earth or other similar planets, as the appropriate sheaths are developed. However, not all souls are human souls. There are many kinds of souls, such as genies, elementals and certain Gods, who evolve toward God through different patterns of evolution than do humans. One cause of unclarity is to confuse the previously mentioned scriptural passages with the theory of biological evolution developed by Charles Darwin (1809 -- 1882), which states that plant and animal species develop or evolve from earlier forms due to hereditary transmission of variations that enhance the organism's adaptability and chances of survival. These principles are now considered the kernel of biology. Modern scientists thus argue that the human form is a development from earlier primates, including apes and monkeys. The Darwinian theory is reasonable but incomplete, as it is based in a materialistic conception of reality that does not encompass the existence of the soul. While the Upanishadic evolutionary vision speaks of the soul's development and progress through reincarnation, the Darwinian theory focuses on evolution of the biological organism, with no relation to a soul or individual being.  </p>

It is not a physical substance, but exists on a subtle level. <i>Ojas</i> is depleted by excessive sex, drugs, excessive talking, loud music, emotional burnout and insufficient rest. Signs of diminished <i>ojas</i> are fear, worry, sensory organ pain, poor complexion, cheerlessness, harshness, emaciation, immune system disorders and tendency to contract diseases (all the symptoms of the modern disease AIDS). Conservation of the vital sexual fluids increases the store of <i>ojas,</i> strengthens the immune system and enhances health and the quality of one's consciousness. <i>Ojas</i> is depleted by ejaculation in men, and by orgasm and menstruation in women. After 30 days of complete sexual abstinence, sperm is transmuted into <i>ojas</i>. This abundance of <i>ojas</i> rises to the brain and becomes centered in the head <i>chakras,</i> where it is expressed as spiritual and intellectual power. Such an individual develops a radiance, called <i>tejas.</i> In the realized being, the energy of <i>ojas</i> is transmuted to Absolute Consciousness as <i>kundalini</i> <i>shakti.</i>  </p>

<p class="word-entry"><i>panchayatana puja</i></p>
<p class="definition">"Five-shrine worship." A system of personal worship, thought to have developed after the 7th century, in the Smarta <i>brahminical</i> tradition, and which is now part of orthodox daily practice for Smartas. The ritual involves the worship of five Deities: Vishnu, Siva, Surya, Ganesha and Shakti. The five are represented by small <i>murtis,</i> or by five kinds of stones, or by five marks drawn on the floor. One is placed in the center as the devotee's preferred God, Ishta Devata, and the other four in a square around it. Kumara, often added as a sixth Deity, is generally situated behind the Ishta Devata. Philosophically, all are seen by Smartas as equal reflections of the one Saguna Brahman, rather than as distinct beings. This arrangement is also represented in Smarta temples, with one in a central sanctum, and the others installed in smaller shrines. Each God may be worshiped in any of His/Her traditional aspects or incarnations, allowing for much variety (e.g., Shakti as Lakshmi, Vishnu as Rama, and Siva as Bhairava). With the addition of the sixth Deity, Kumara, the system is known as <i>shanmata,</i> "sixfold path." This system has laid the foundation for the modern secular or neo-Indian religion, in which Hindus freely add Jesus, Mother Mary, Mohammed, Buddha or other holy personages to their altars. This modern syncretism has no basis in traditional scripture.  </p>

<p class="word-entry"><i>papa</i></p>
<p class="definition">"Wickedness or sin;" "crime." 1) Bad or evil. 2) Wrongful action. 3) Demerit earned through wrongdoing. Papa includes all forms of wrongdoing, from the simplest infraction to the most heinous crime, such as premeditated murder. Each act of <i>papa</i> carries its <i>karmic</i> consequence, <i>karmaphala,</i> "fruit of action," for which scriptures delineate specific penance for expiation. Those who have awakened psychic sight can clearly see <i>papa</i> in the inner subconscious aura as a colorful, sticky, astral substance. <i>Papa</i> is seen as dark unrelated colors, whereas its counterpart, <i>punya,</i> is seen as pastels. The color arrangements are not unlike modern art murals. <i>Papa</i> colors can produce disease, depression, loneliness and such, but can be dissolved through penance <i>(prayashchitta),</i> austerity <i>(tapas)</i> and good deeds <i>(sukritya).</i> There are specific consequences, <i>karmaphala,</i> "fruit of action," that result from each type of transgression of <i>dharma.</i> For example, a man who steals from his neighbors creates a cosmic debt which may be repaid later by having his own possessions taken away. There are also specific penances, <i>prayashchitta,</i> that can be performed for atonement and the accrual of <i>punya</i> (merit) to balance out the <i>papa,</i> the negative <i>karma</i> of the wrongful act. Such disciplines are provided in the various <i>Dharma Shastras</i> and prescribed by knowing preceptors, <i>panditas, shastris, swamis, yogis</i> and village elders according to the <i>varna</i> and education of the individual. For example, the <i>Laws of Manu</i> give several types of penance for the crime of murder, including 1) making a forest hut and subsisting there on alms for twelve years and using a human skull as one's emblem; or 2) walking 100 <i>yojanas</i> (900 miles), while reciting the <i>Vedas,</i> eating little and remaining continent. A contemporary example: if a man fells a large healthy tree, he may atone by planting ten trees and ensuring that at least one grows to replace it. The degree of <i>papa</i> accrued from an action depends on various factors, including the <i>karma, dharma</i> and spiritual advancement of the individual, the intent or motivation, as well as the time and place of the action (for example, unvirtuous deeds carry great demerit when performed in holy places). <i>Papa</i> is the opposite of <i>punya</i> (merit, virtue).  </p>

<p class="definition">Monistic and theistic, this school of Saivism reveres Siva as Supreme Cause and Personal Ruler of soul and world, denoted in His form as Pashupati, "Lord of souls." This school centers around the ascetic path, emphasizing <i>sadhana,</i> detachment from the world and the quest for "internal <i>kundalini</i> grace." The <i>Karavana Mahatmya</i> recounts the birth of Lakulisa (ca 200 BCE), a principal Pashupata <i>guru,</i> and refers to the temple of Somanatha as one of the most important Pashupata centers. Lakulisa propounded a Saiva monism, though indications are that Pashupata philosophy was previously dualistic, with Siva as efficient cause of the universe but not material cause. It is thought to be the source of various ascetic streams, including the Kapalikas and the Kalamukhas. This school is represented today in the broad <i>sadhu</i> tradition, and numerous Pashupata sites of worship are scattered across India.  </p>

These are the three primary elements (<i>padartha,</i> or <i>tattvatrayi)</i> of Saiva Siddhanta philosophy: God, soul and world -- Divinity, man and cosmos -- seen as a mystically and intricately interrelated unity. Pati is God, envisioned as a cowherd. <i>Pashu</i> is the soul, envisioned as a cow. <i>Pasha</i> is the all-important force or fetter by which God brings souls along the path to Truth. The various schools of Hinduism define the rapport among the three in varying ways. For pluralistic Saiva Siddhantins they are three beginningless verities, self-existent, eternal entities. For monistic Saiva Siddhantins, <i>pashu</i> and <i>pasha</i> are the emanational creation of Pati, Lord Siva, and He alone is eternal reality. </p>

<p class="word-entry">penance</p>
<p class="definition"><i>Prayashchitta.</i> Atonement, expiation. An act of devotion <i>(bhakti),</i> austerity <i>(tapas)</i> or discipline <i>(sukritya)</i> undertaken to soften or nullify the anticipated reaction of a past action. Penance is uncomfortable <i>karma</i> inflicted upon oneself to mitigate one's <i>karmic</i> burden caused by wrongful actions <i>(kukarma).</i> Consciously relieving the karmic burden of wrongful actions by undergoing physical or mental hardships and challenges. It includes such acts as prostrating 108 times, fasting, self-denial, or carrying <i>kavadi</i> (public penance), as well as more extreme austerities, or <i>tapas.</i> Penance is often suggested by spiritual leaders and elders. Penitence or repentance, suffering regret for misdeeds, is called <i>anutapa,</i> meaning "to heat." -- bala tadayati prayashchitta: "Child-beating penance," performed to mitigate the <i>papa,</i> sometimes called sin, accrued by having beaten a child. First, the adult counts the number of slaps or hits -- with cane, stick, strap, hand, or fist -- that he (or she) administered to children in the past. Then he meditates on the extent of harm he caused and in what ways. He lets the reality of this live with him for a week or two. (He may, at first, deny it, rationalize it, explain it away to himself, tell himself that there are a dozen reasons why striking a child was necessary, useful, customary and therefore acceptable. But all is Siva, and no violence toward another human being, let alone our own flesh and blood, is acceptable.) Once acceptance is complete, while looking into a large mirror, he administers upon his own body five hits for each one he gave to a child, with hand, cane, belt, etc., in the exact area of the body where the hurt was felt by the child. This may take time, and it should be painful. Thus, looking in the mirror, he slaps himself five times for every slap he gave each child, pinches himself five times for every pinch given, etc. After this phase of the <i>prayashchitta</i> has been completed and the abuser feels much relieved of the heavy <i>karmas,</i> the abuser must 1) apologize to all the children he has abused and assure them that he will no longer ever use corporal punishment, but instead use positive discipline. 2) Then he assures the children under his influence that he will protect them from such brutality at home and in school. 3) Next, he writes to his <i>satguru</i> or other mentor about his penance, indicating if the guilt has passed and inner peace has returned. He includes a handwritten pledge, <i>vrata,</i> stating: A) that he will never inflict such abuse ever again; and B) that he will notify the school that children must be treated with respect and kindness and receive no beating of any kind, and that any misbehavior by children under his care should be reported to him by teachers so that appropriate discipline can be administered at home. 4) Once the mentor responds, the penance is complete. -- pushpa prayashchitta: "Flower penance." Those who have been physically abused are as much in need of penance to mitigate the experience as are those who abused them. Each person -- child or adult -- who has been beaten at any time, no matter how long ago, is enjoined to put up in the shrine room a picture of the person or persons by whom they were beaten, be it a father, mother or teacher. Then, every day for thirty-one days, he or she places a flower in front of each picture and, while doing so, sincerely forgiving the person in heart and mind. If no picture is available then some symbol or possession can be substituted, or even a paper with the name written on it. -- krodha prayashchitta: "Anger penance." Anger arises from the second <i>chakra</i> below the <i>muladhara,</i> the <i>vitala chakra,</i> and when that force center begins to vibrate, it vibrates in many different ways, spinning counterclockwise, causing disturbance to the natural <i>shanti</i> that otherwise prevails. Below are the some of the various faces of anger that the <i>vitala chakra</i> gives rise to. For each, a monetary sum is paid to compensate, as a form of penance, for allowing oneself to sink into this hurtful, unwholesome state of mind. Angry emotions that are suppressed: US$.10. Raising one's voice to emphasize a point: $.25. Pouting and turning the head away: $.50. Saying unkind things, unnecessary snide remarks: $.75. Sharp comments uttered in a raspy voice: $1.00. Long, brooding silences (an expression of anger that appears peaceful but is a way of cutting a person out of one's life): $2.00. (Mental arguments happen during those silences, deafening silences, loud deafening silences, during which thought swirls around how to retaliate or refute the other person's point.) A deeply cutting remark or hurtful insinuation or criticism of a personal nature: $2.50. A long, angry dissertation as to how others are totally wrong and how matters cannot continue in this way any longer: $4.00. An angry rage in which the aura turns black-red, or a jealous outburst in which one emphasizes, "I am in command. You are the serfs. You obey me, because you fear me." Or "You are wrong, and I don't like you. You did something terrible, unforgivable, stupid...(and such hateful things)" $5.00. For the wealthy, each of these amounts can be doubled; for the very wealthy, quadrupled. A jar labeled "Krodha Prayashchitta" is established in the shrine room to receive the payments. The sum collected is sent to a charity on the first Sunday of each month. </p>

<p class="definition">Egypt-born Greek philosopher (205 -- 270), one of the Western world's greatest known mystics, who extended and revived the work of the Greek philosopher Plato in the Roman Empire.

Man, he said, is a microcosm of this system, capable of attaining the sublime inner state through enstasy. He practiced and taught <i>ahimsa</i>, vegetarianism, <i>karma,</i> reincarnation and belief in Supreme Being as both immanent and transcendent. His writings, in six divisions, are called the <i>Enneads.</i> He was apparently familiar with Hindu wisdom through reading <i>Life of Apollonius of Tyana,</i> a partly fictionalized biography of a Greek renunciate who is said to have visited India.   </p>

Prakriti is the manifesting aspect, as contrasted with the quiescent unmanifest -- Purusha, which is pure consciousness. In Shaktism, Prakriti, the active principle, is personified as Devi, the Goddess, and is synonymous with Maya. Prakriti is thus often seen, and depicted so in the <i>Puranas,</i> as the Divine Mother, whose love and care embrace and comfort all beings. In Saivite cosmology, <i>prakriti</i> is the 24th of 36 <i>tattvas,</i> the potentiality of the physical cosmos, the gross energy from which all lower <i>tattvas</i> are formed.

<p class="word-entry"><i>prapatti</i></p>
<p class="definition">"Throwing oneself down." <i>Bhakti</i>, total, unconditional submission to God, often coupled with the attitude of personal helplessness, self-effacement and resignation. A term especially used in Vaishnavism to name a concept extremely central to virtually all Hindu schools. In Saiva Siddhanta, <i>bhakti</i> is all important in the development of the soul and its release into spiritual maturity. The doctrine is perhaps best expressed in the teachings of the four Samayacharya saints, who all shared a profound and mystical love of Siva marked by 1) deep humility and self-effacement, admission of sin and weakness; 2) total surrender in God as the only true refuge and 3) a relationship of lover and beloved known as bridal mysticism, in which the devotee is the bride and Siva the bridegroom. The practice of <i>yoga,</i> too, is an expression of love of God in Saiva Siddhanta, and it is only with God's grace that success is achieved. Rishi Tirumular states: "Unless your heart melts in the sweet ecstasy of love -- my Lord, my treasure-trove, you can never possess" <i>(Tirumantiram</i> 272). It is in this concept of the need for self-effacement and total surrender, <i>prapatti,</i> that the members of all sects merge in oneness, at the fulfillment of their individual paths. Similarly, they all meet in unity at the beginning of the path with the worship of Lord Ganesha.  </p>

<p class="definition">"Worship, adoration." An Agamic rite of worship performed in the home, temple or shrine, to the <i>murti</i>, <i>shri paduka,</i> or other consecrated object, or to a person, such as the <i>satguru.</i> Its inner purpose is to purify the atmosphere around the object worshiped, establish a connection with the inner worlds and invoke the presence of God, Gods or one's <i>guru</i>. During <i>puja</i>, the officiant <i>(pujari)</i> recites various chants praising the Divine and beseeching divine blessings, while making offerings in accordance with established traditions. <i>Puja,</i> the worship of a <i>murti</i> through water, lights and flowers in temples and shrines, is the Agamic counterpart of the Vedic <i>yajna</i> rite, in which offerings are conveyed through the sacred <i>homa</i> fire. On special days additional offerings are made, and as part of the puja, <i>abhishekam</i> or ritual bathing of the Deity is often performed as well. Items blessed during the ceremony, known as <i>prasadam</i> or sacraments, are distributed to the attendant devotees after the rite. Puja is also performed to one's guru. These are the two great streams of adoration and communion in Hinduism. Central steps of <i>puja</i> include: 1) <i>achamana,</i> water sipping for purification; 2) <i>Ganapati prarthana,</i> prayers to Ganesha; 3) <i>sankalpa,</i> declaration of intent; 4) <i>ghanta,</i> ringing bell, inviting <i>devas</i> and dismissing <i>asuras</i>; 5) <i>avahana,</i> inviting the Deity ; 6) <i>mantras</i> and <i>dhyana,</i> meditating on the Deity; 7) <i>svagata,</i> welcoming; 8) <i>namaskara,</i> obeisance; 9) <i>arghyam,</i> water offerings; 10) <i>pradakshina,</i> circumambulation; 11) <i>abhisheka,</i> bathing the <i>murti;</i> 12) <i>dhupa,</i> incense-offering; 13) <i>dipa,</i> offering lights; 14) <i>naivedya,</i> offering food; 15) <i>archana,</i> chanting holy names; 16) <i>arati,</i> final offering of lights; 17) <i>prarthana,</i> personal requests; 18) <i>visarjana,</i> dismissal-farewell. Also central are <i>pranayama</i> (breath control), <i>guru vandana</i> (adoration of the preceptor), <i>nyasa</i> (empowerment through touching) and <i>mudra</i> (mystic gestures). <i>Puja</i> offerings also include <i>pushpa</i> (flowers), <i>arghya</i> (water), <i>tambula</i> (betel leaf) and <i>chandana</i> (sandalpaste). -- atmartha puja: <i>Karana Agama</i>, v. 2, states: <i>Atmartha cha parartha cha puja dvividhamuchyate,</i> "Worship is twofold: for the benefit of oneself and for the benefit of others." <i>Atmartha puja</i> is done for oneself and immediate family, usually at home in a private shrine.  -- parartha puja: "<i>Puja</i> for others." <i>Parartha puja</i> is public <i>puja</i>, performed by authorized or ordained priests in a public shrine or temple. </p>

<p class="word-entry"><i>punya</i></p>
<p class="definition">"Holy; virtuous; auspicious." 1) Good or righteous. 2) Meritorious action. 3) Merit earned through right thought, word and action. <i>Punya</i> includes all forms of doing good, from the simplest helpful deed to a lifetime of conscientious beneficence. Each act of <i>punya</i> carries its <i>karmic</i> consequence, <i>karmaphala,</i> "fruit of action" <i>--</i> the positive reward of actions, words and deeds that are in keeping with <i>dharma</i>. Awakened psychics who have developed clairvoyant sight can clearly see the <i>punya</i> accrued in the inner subconscious aura as a colorful, free-flowing, astral, light-energy, <i>pranic</i> substance. <i>Punya</i> is seen as light-hued, pastel colors, whereas its counterpart, <i>papa,</i> is seen as shades of darker colors which are usually static and immovable. These variegations of the <i>papa</i> shades and <i>punya</i> hues are not unlike the free-expression paintings found in modern art. <i>Punya</i> colors produce inner contentment, deep joy, the feeling of security and fearlessness. <i>Papa</i> can be dissolved and <i>punya</i> created through penance <i>(prayashchitta),</i> austerity <i>(tapas)</i> and good deeds <i>(sukritya). Punya</i> is earned through virtuous living, following the multi-faceted laws of <i>dharma. Punya</i> depends on purity of acts according to various factors including 1) the <i>karma</i> and evolution of the individual, 2) degree of sacrifice and unselfish motivation and 3) time and place. For example, virtuous deeds, <i>sadhana,</i> <i>tapas</i> and penance have greater merit when performed in holy places and at auspicious times. The <i>Tirukural</i> (105) states that "Help rendered another cannot be measured by the extent of the assistance given. Its true measure is the worth of the recipient." In other words, a small act done for a great and worthy soul carries more <i>punya</i> than even a large act performed for a lesser person. (Opposite of <i>papa.)</i>  </p>

<p class="word-entry">purity-impurity</p>
<p class="definition"><i>Shaucha-ashaucha.</i> Purity and its opposite, pollution, are a fundamental part of Hindu culture. While they refer to physical cleanliness, their more important meanings extend to social, ceremonial, mental, emotional, psychic and spiritual cleanliness or contamination. Freedom from all forms of contamination is a key to Hindu spirituality, and is one of the <i>yamas.</i> Physical purity requires a clean and well-ordered environment, <i>yogic</i> purging of the internal organs and frequent cleansing with water. Mental purity derives from meditation, right living and right thinking. Emotional purity depends on control of the mind, clearing the subconscious and keeping good company. Spiritual purity is achieved through following the <i>yamas</i> and <i>niyamas,</i> study of the <i>Vedas</i> and other scriptures, pilgrimage, meditation, <i>japa,</i> <i>tapas</i> and <i>ahimsa.</i> Ritual purity requires the observance of certain <i>prayashchittas,</i> or penances, for defilement derived from foreign travel, contact with base people or places, conversion to other faiths, contact with bodily wastes, attending a funeral, etc. Purity is of three forms -- purity in mind, speech and body, or thought, word and deed. Purity is the pristine and natural state of the soul. Impurity, or pollution, is the obscuring of this state by adulterating experience and beclouding conceptions. In daily life, the Hindu strives to protect this innate purity by wise living, following the codes of <i>dharma.</i> This includes harnessing the sexual energies, associating with other virtuous Hindu devotees, never using harsh, angered or indecent language, and keeping a clean and healthy physical body.  </p>

In the Sankhya system, Purusha is one of two supreme, beginningless realities: spirit and matter, Purusha and Prakriti, the male and female principles. It is the quiescent unmanifest, pure consciousness, contrasted with Prakriti, the manifesting, primal nature from which the cosmos unfolds. In Saiva cosmology, <i>purusha</i> is the 25th of 36 <i>tattvas,</i> one level subtler than <i>prakriti.</i> Beyond these lie the subtle realms of <i>shuddha maya.</i> Transcending all the <i>tattvas</i> is Parashiva.  </p>

<p class="definition">Technically speaking, each of the five varieties of man (Caucasoid, Congoid, Mongoloid, Australoid and Capoid) is a <i>Homo sapiens</i> subspecies. A subspecies is a branch showing slight but significant differences from another branch living in a different area. Few traits are unique to any one race. It is the combination of several traits that indicate racial identity. Accurate race determination can be made by blood analysis or by measuring and comparing certain body dimensions. Ninety-eight percent of all Hindus belong to the Caucasoid race. There are also large numbers of Hindu Mongoloids in Nepal and Assam and some Australoids, such as the Gond and Bhil tribes of India. North and South Indians are among Earth's 2.5 billion Caucasoids, whose traits include straight to wavy hair, thin lips, small to medium teeth, blue to dark brown eyes and a high incident of A -Rh and Gm blood genes. Skin color, often erroneously attached to the idea of race, is now known to be adaptation to climate: over generations, people in northern climates have developed lighter complexions than their southern brothers. In a more general sense, the term <i>race</i> can apply to any geographical, national or tribal ethnic group, or to mankind as a whole, as "the human race."  </p>

<hr />
<p class="word-entry">reincarnation</p>
<p class="definition">"Re-entering the flesh." <i>Punarjanma;</i> metempsychosis. The process wherein souls take on a physical body through the birth process. Reincarnation is one of the fundamental principles of Hindu spiritual insight, shared by the mystical schools of nearly all religions, including Jainism, Sikhism, Buddhism (and even Christianity until condemned by the Nicene Council of 787). It is against the backdrop of this principle of the soul's enjoying many lives that other aspects of Hinduism can be understood. It is a repetitive cycle, known as <i>punarjanma,</i> which originates in the subtle plane (Antarloka), the realm in which souls live between births and return to after death. Here they are assisted in readjusting to the "in-between" world and eventually prepared for yet another birth. The quality and nature of the birth depends on the merit or demerit of their past actions <i>(karma)</i> and on the needs of their unique pattern of development and experience <i>(dharma).</i> The mother, the father and the soul together create a new body for the soul. At the moment of conception, the soul connects with and is irrevocably bound to the embryo. As soon as the egg is fertilized, the process of human life begins. It is during the mid-term of pregnancy that the full humanness of the fetus is achieved and the soul fully inhabits the new body, a stage which is acknowledged when the child begins to move and kick within the mother's womb. (<i>Tirumantiram,</i> 460: "There in the pregnant womb, the soul lay in primordial quiescence [<i>turiya</i>] state. From that state, Maya [or Prakriti] and Her tribe aroused it and conferred consciousness and <i>maya's</i> evolutes eight -- desires and the rest. Thus say scriptures holy and true.") Finally, at birth the soul emerges into earth consciousness, veiled of all memory of past lives and the inner worlds. The cycle of reincarnation ends when <i>karma</i> has been resolved and the Self God (Parashiva) has been realized. This condition of release is called <i>moksha</i>. Then the soul continues to evolve and mature, but without the need to return to physical existence. How many earthly births must one have to attain the unattainable? Many thousands to be sure, hastened by righteous living, <i>tapas,</i> austerities on all levels, penance and good deeds in abundance.  </p>

<p class="word-entry"><i>Rig Veda</i></p>
<p class="definition"><i>"Veda</i> of verse <i>(rik).</i>" The first and oldest of the four <i>Veda</i> corpora of revealed scriptures <i>(shruti),</i> including a hymn collection <i>(Samhita),</i> priestly explanatory manuals <i>(Brahmanas),</i> forest treatises <i>(Aranyakas)</i> elaborating on the Vedic rites, and philosophical dialogs <i>(Upanishads).</i> Like the other <i>Vedas,</i> the <i>Rig Veda</i> was brought to earth consciousness not all at once, but gradually, over a period of perhaps several thousand years. The oldest and core portion is the <i>Samhita,</i> believed to date back, in its oral form, as far as 8,000 years, and to have been written down in archaic Sanskrit some 3,000 years ago. It consists of more than 10,000 verses, averaging three or four lines <i>(riks),</i> forming 1,028 hymns <i>(suktas),</i> organized in ten books called <i>mandalas.</i> It embodies prayerful hymns of praise and invocation to the Divinities of nature and to the One Divine. They are the spiritual reflections of a pastoral people with a profound awe for the powers of nature, each of which they revered as sacred and alive. The <i>rishis</i> who unfolded these outpourings of adoration perceived a well-ordered cosmos in which <i>dharma</i> is the way of attunement with celestial worlds, from which all righteousness and prosperity descends. The main concern is man's relationship with God and the world, and the invocation of the subtle worlds into mundane existence. Prayers beseech the Gods for happy family life, wealth, pleasure, cattle, health, protection from enemies, strength in battle, matrimony, progeny, long life and happiness, wisdom and realization and final liberation from rebirth. The <i>Rig Veda Samhita,</i> which in length equals Homer's <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i> combined, is the most important hymn collection, for it lends a large number of its hymns to the other three <i>Veda Samhitas</i> (the <i>Sama, Yajur</i> and <i>Atharva)</i>. Chronologically, after the <i>Samhitas</i> came the <i>Brahmanas,</i> followed by the <i>Aranyakas,</i> and finally the <i>Upanishads,</i> also called the <i>Vedanta,</i> meaning <i>"Veda's</i> end."  </p>

<p class="word-entry">rites of passage</p>
<p class="definition">Sacraments marking crucial stages of life. As the <i>Nandinatha Sutras</i> indicate, rites of passage, sacraments or <i>samskaras</i> are special moments in life that are preciously guarded by all members of the community. Thus, tradition indicates certain restrictions as to who may attend, though those who do not attend may participate in preparations and receptions afterwards. Those who refrain from attending rites of passage include widows and widowers, <i>brahmacharis</i> and <i>brahmacharinis</i> and anyone who has been divorced. The reason is to protect the impressionable subconscious mind of those receiving the sacrament from the impressions of the possibilities of renunciation, widowhood and divorce. Funeral rites, however, are open to everyone, though a couple just married within the past year will stay away. Other important funeral customs are: 1) a son who would normally light the pyre for his parents will not if his wife is pregnant. Instead, a cousin or brother will take his place; 2) when a widow is at her husband's funeral rites, the other widows of the village gather around her, not the married couples. Note that if a widowed person remarries, he or she is no longer considered a widow or widower and may attend rites of passage with his or her new spouse. </p>

Smaller beads (usually numbering 108) are strung together for japa (recitation). Indian legend records that God shed a tear when looking down upon the sorrowful plight of humanity.

<p class="definition"><i>Yajna.</i> 1) Presenting offerings to a Deity as an expression of homage and devotion. 2) Giving up something, often one's own possession, advantage or preference, to serve a higher purpose. The literal meaning of <i>sacrifice</i> is "to make sacred," implying an act of worship. It is the most common translation of the term <i>yajna,</i> from the verb <i>yuj,</i> "to worship." In Hinduism, all of life is a sacrifice -- called <i>jivayajna,</i> a giving of oneself -- through which comes true spiritual fulfillment. <i>Tyaga,</i> the power of detachment, is an essential quality of true sacrifice.  </p>

<p class="word-entry"><i>Saiva Agamas</i></p>
<p class="definition">The sectarian revealed scriptures of the Saivas. Strongly theistic, they identify Siva as the Supreme Lord, immanent and transcendent. They are in two main divisions: the 64 <i>Kashmir Saiva Agamas</i> and the 28 <i>Saiva Siddhanta Agamas.</i> The latter group are the fundamental sectarian scriptures of Saiva Siddhanta. Of these, ten are of the <i>Sivabheda</i> division and are considered dualistic: 1) <i>Kamika,</i> 2) <i>Yogaja,</i> 3) <i>Chintya,</i> 4) <i>Karana,</i> 5) <i>Ajita,</i> 6) <i>Dipta,</i> 7) <i>Sukshma,</i> 8) <i>Sahasraka,</i> 9) <i>Amshumat</i> and 10) <i>Suprabheda.</i> There are 18 in the <i>Rudrabheda</i> group, classed as dual-nondual: 11) <i>Vijaya,</i> 12) <i>Nihshvasa,</i> 13) <i>Svayambhuva,</i> 14) <i>Anala,</i> 15) <i>Vira (Bhadra),</i> 16) <i>Raurava,</i> 17) <i>Makuta,</i> 18) <i>Vimala,</i> 19) <i>Chandrajnana</i> (or <i>Chandrahasa),</i> 20) <i>Mukhabimba</i> (or <i>Bimba),</i> 21) <i>Prodgita</i> (or <i>Udgita),</i> 22) <i>Lalita,</i> 23) <i>Siddha,</i> 24) <i>Santana,</i> 25) <i>Sarvokta (Narasimha),</i> 26) <i>Parameshvara,</i> 27) <i>Kirana</i> and 28) <i>Vatula</i> (or <i>Parahita).</i> Rishi Tirumular, in his <i>Tirumantiram</i>, refers to 28 <i>Agamas</i> and mentions nine by name. Eight of these -- <i>Karana, Kamika, Vira, Chintya, Vatula, Vimala, Suprabheda</i> and <i>Makuta</i> -- are in the above list of 28 furnished by the French Institute of Indology, Pondicherry. The ninth, <i>Kalottara</i>, is presently regarded as an <i>Upagama,</i> or secondary text, of <i>Vatula</i>. The <i>Kamika</i> is the <i>Agama</i> most widely followed in Tamil Saiva temples, because of the availability of Aghorasiva's manual-commentary <i>(paddhati)</i> on it. Vira Saivites especially refer to the <i>Vatula</i> and <i>Vira Agamas.</i> The <i>Saiva Agama</i> scriptures, above all else, are the connecting strand through all the schools of Saivism. The <i>Agamas</i> themselves express that they are entirely consistent with the teachings of the <i>Veda,</i> that they contain the essence of the <i>Veda,</i> and must be studied with the same high degree of devotion.  </p>

<p class="definition">"Final conclusions of Saivism." The most widespread and influential Saivite school today, predominant especially among the Tamil people of Sri Lanka and South India. It is the formalized theology of the divine revelations contained in the twenty-eight <i>Saiva Agamas</i>. The first known <i>guru</i> of the Shuddha ("pure") Saiva Siddhanta tradition was Maharishi Nandinatha of Kashmir (ca BCE 250), recorded in Panini's book of grammar as the teacher of <i>rishis</i> Patanjali, Vyaghrapada and Vasishtha. Other sacred scriptures include the <i>Tirumantiram</i> and the voluminous collection of devotional hymns, the <i>Tirumurai,</i> and the masterpiece on ethics and statecraft, the <i>Tirukural</i>. For Saiva Siddhantins, Siva is the totality of all, understood in three perfections: Parameshvara (the Personal Creator Lord), Parashakti (the substratum of form) and Parashiva (Absolute Reality which transcends all). Souls and world are identical in essence with Siva, yet also differ in that they are evolving. A pluralistic stream arose in the middle ages from the teachings of Aghorasiva and Meykandar. For Aghorasiva's school (ca 1150) Siva is not the material cause of the universe, and the soul attains perfect "sameness" with Siva upon liberation. Meykandar's (ca 1250) pluralistic school denies that souls ever attain perfect sameness or unity with Siva.  </p>

<p class="word-entry">Saivism (Saiva)</p>
<p class="definition">The religion followed by those who worship Siva as supreme God. Oldest of the four sects of Hinduism. The earliest historical evidence of Saivism is from the 8,000-year-old Indus Valley civilization in the form of the famous seal of Siva as Lord Pashupati, seated in a <i>yogic</i> pose. In the <i>Ramayana</i>, dated astronomically at 2000 BCE, Lord Rama worshiped Siva, as did his rival Ravana. Buddha in 624 BCE was born into a Saivite family, and records of his time speak of the Saiva ascetics who wandered the hills looking much as they do today. There are many schools of Saivism, six of which are Saiva Siddhanta, Pashupata Saivism, Kashmir Saivism, Vira Saivism, Siddha Siddhanta and Siva Advaita. They are based firmly on the <i>Vedas</i> and <i>Saiva Agamas,</i> and thus have much in common, including the following principal doctrines: 1) the five powers of Siva -- creation, preservation, destruction, revealing and concealing grace; 2) The three categories: Pati, <i>pashu</i> and <i>pasha</i> ("God, souls and bonds"); 3) the three bonds: <i>anava, karma</i> and <i>maya;</i> 4) the threefold power of Siva: <i>icchha shakti, kriya shakti</i> and <i>jnana shakti;</i> 5) the thirty-six <i>tattvas,</i> or categories of existence; 6) the need for initiation from a <i>satguru;</i> 7) the power of <i>mantra;</i> 8) the four <i>padas</i> (stages): <i>charya</i> (selfless service)<i>, kriya</i> (devotion)<i>, yoga</i> (meditation), and <i>jnana</i> (illumination)<i>;</i> 9) the belief in the Panchakshara as the foremost <i>mantra,</i> and in <i>rudraksha</i> and <i>vibhuti</i> as sacred aids to faith; 10) the beliefs in <i>satguru</i> (preceptor), Sivalinga (object of worship) and <i>sangama</i> (company of holy persons).  </p>

<p class="word-entry">Saivism (six schools)</p>
<p class="definition">Through history Saivism has developed a vast array of lineages. Philosophically, six schools are most notable: Saiva Siddhanta, Pashupata Saivism, Kashmir Saivism, Vira Saivism, Siddha Siddhanta and Siva Advaita. Saiva Siddhanta first distinguished itself in the second century BCE through the masterful treatise of a Himalayan pilgrim to South India, Rishi Tirumular. It is Saivism's most widespread and influential school. Pashupata Saivism emerged in the Himalayan hills over 25 centuries ago. Ancient writings chronicle it as a Saiva ascetic <i>yoga</i> path whose most renowned <i>guru</i> was Lakulisa. Kashmir Saivism, a strongly monistic lineage, arose from the revelatory aphorisms of Sri Vasugupta in the tenth century. Vira Saivism took shape in India's Karnataka state in the 12th-century under the inspiration of Sri Basavanna. It is a dynamic, reformist sect, rejecting religious complexity and stressing each devotee's personal relationship with God. Siddha Siddhanta, also known as Gorakshanatha Saivism, takes its name from the writings of the powerful 10th-century <i>yogi,</i> Sri Gorakshanatha, whose techniques for Siva identity attracted a large monastic and householder following in North India and Nepal. Siva Advaita is a Saivite interpretation of the Vedanta Sutras, based on the writings of Srikantha, a 12th-century scholar who sought to reconcile the <i>Upanishads</i> with the <i>Agamas.</i>  </p>

Progress through <i>sakala avastha</i> is measured in three stages: 1) <i>irul</i>, "darkness;" when the impetus is toward <i>pasha,</i> knowledge and experience of the world <i>(pasha-jnanam</i>); 2) <i>marul</i>, "confusion;" caught between the world and God, the soul begins to turn within for knowledge of its own nature <i>(pashu-jnanam</i>); and 3) <i>arul</i>, "grace," when the soul seeks to know God (Pati-<i>jnanam</i>); and receive His grace. </p>

Its highest form is the realization of the primal substratum or pure consciousness, Satchidananda. The second is <i>nirvikalpa</i> <i>samadhi</i> ("enstasy without form" or "seed"), identification with the Self, in which all modes of consciousness are transcended and Absolute Reality, Parashiva, beyond time, form and space, is experienced. This brings in its aftermath a complete transformation of consciousness. In Classical Yoga, <i>nirvikalpa samadhi</i> is known as <i>asamprajnata samadhi,</i> "supraconscious enstasy" -- <i>samadhi,</i> or beingness, without thought or cognition, <i>prajna</i>. <i>Savikalpa samadhi</i> is also called <i>samprajnata samadhi,</i> "conscious enstasy." (Note that <i>samadhi</i> differs from <i>samyama</i> -- the continuous meditation on a subject or mystic key [such as a <i>chakra</i>] to gain revelation on that subject or area of consciousness.

However, there are certain orders which accept men into <i>sannyasa</i> after age 25, provided they have been in college and not in the world after that time. Others will accept widowers; and a few initiate women. Such rules and qualifications apply primarily to cenobites, that is, to those who will live and serve together in an <i>ashrama</i> or monastery.

<p class="word-entry"><i>shad darshana</i></p>
<p class="definition">"Six views," "six insights." Six classical philosophies distinguished among the hundreds of Hindu <i>darshanas</i> known through history: Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Sankhya, Yoga, Mimamsa and Vedanta. Each was tersely formulated in <i>sutra</i> form by its "founder," and elaborated in extensive commentaries by other writers. They are understood as varied attempts at describing Truth and the path to it. Elements of each form part of the Hindu fabric today. -- <b>Nyaya: </b>"System, rule; logic." A system of logical realism, founded sometime around 300 BCE by Gautama, known for its systems of logic and epistemology and concerned with the means of acquiring right knowledge. Its tools of enquiry and rules for argumentation were adopted by all schools of Hinduism. -- <b>Vaisheshika: "</b>Differentiation," from <i>vishesha, "</i>differences." Philosophy founded by Kanada (ca 300 BCE) teaching that liberation is to be attained through understanding the nature of existence, which is classified in nine basic realities <i>(dravyas)</i>: earth, water, light, air, ether, time, space, soul and mind. Nyaya and Vaisheshika are viewed as a complementary pair, with Nyaya emphasizing logic, and Vaisheshika analyzing the nature of the world. -- <b>Sankhya:</b> "Enumeration, reckoning." A philosophy founded by the sage Kapila (ca 500 BCE), author of the <i>Sankhya Sutras.</i> Sankhya is primarily concerned with "categories of existence," <i>tattvas,</i> which it understands as 25 in number. The first two are the unmanifest Purusha and the manifest primal nature, Prakriti <i>--</i> the male-female polarity, viewed as the foundation of all existence. Prakriti, out of which all things evolve, is the unity of the three <i>gunas: sattva, rajas</i> and <i>tamas.</i> Sankhya and Yoga are considered an inseparable pair whose principles permeate all of Hinduism. See: <i>prakriti, purusha</i>. -- <b>Yoga: </b>"Yoking; joining." Ancient tradition of philosophy and practice codified by Patanjali (ca 200 BCE) in the <i>Yoga Sutras</i>. It is also known as <i>raja yoga</i>, "king of <i>yogas,"</i> or <i>ashtanga yoga</i>, "eight-limbed <i>yoga."</i> Its object is to achieve, at will, the cessation of all fluctuations of consciousness, and the attainment of Self Realization. Yoga is wholly dedicated to putting the high philosophy of Hinduism into practice, to achieve personal transformation through transcendental experience, <i>samadhi.</i> See: <i>yoga</i>. -- <b>Mimamsa: </b>"Inquiry" (or Purva, "early," Mimamsa). Founded by Jaimini (ca 200 BCE), author of the <i>Mimamsa Sutras,</i> who taught the correct performance of Vedic rites as the means to salvation. -- V<b>edanta </b>(or Uttara "later" Mimamsa): "End (or culmination) of the <i>Vedas</i>." For Vedanta, the main basis is the <i>Upanishads</i> and <i>Aranyakas</i> (the "end," <i>anta,</i> of the <i>Vedas),</i> rather than the hymns and ritual portions of the <i>Vedas.</i> The teaching of Vedanta is that there is one Absolute Reality, Brahman. Man is one with Brahman, and the object of life is to realize that truth through right knowledge, intuition and personal experience. The <i>Vedanta Sutras</i> (or <i>Brahma Sutras)</i> were composed by Rishi Badarayana (ca 400 BCE). </p>

<p class="word-entry">Shakti</p>
<p class="definition">"Power, energy." The active power or manifest energy of Siva that pervades all of existence. Its most refined aspect is Parashakti, or Satchidananda, the pure consciousness and primal substratum of all form. This pristine, divine energy unfolds as <i>icchha shakti</i> (the power of desire, will, love), <i>kriya shakti</i> (the power of action) and <i>jnana shakti</i> (the power of wisdom, knowing), represented as the three prongs of Siva's <i>trishula,</i> or trident. From these arise the five powers of revealment, concealment, dissolution, preservation and creation. In Saiva Siddhanta, Siva is All, and His divine energy, Shakti, is inseparable from Him. This unity is symbolized in the image of Ardhanarishvara, "half-female God." In popular, village Hinduism, the unity of Siva and Shakti is replaced with the concept of Siva and Shakti as separate entities. Shakti is represented as female, and Siva as male. In Hindu temples, art and mythology, they are everywhere seen as the divine couple. This depiction has its source in the folk-narrative sections of the <i>Puranas,</i> where it is given elaborate expression. Shakti is personified in many forms as the consorts of the Gods. For example, the Goddesses Parvati, Lakshmi and Sarasvati are the respective mythological consorts of Siva, Vishnu and Brahma. Philosophically, however, the caution is always made that God and God's energy are One, and the metaphor of the inseparable divine couple serves only to illustrate this Oneness. Within the Shakta religion, the worship of the Goddess is paramount, in Her many fierce and benign forms. Shakti is the Divine Mother of manifest creation, visualized as a female form, and Siva is specifically the Unmanifest Absolute. The fierce or black <i>(asita)</i> forms of the Goddess include Kali, Durga, Chandi, Chamundi, Bhadrakali and Bhairavi. The benign or white <i>(sita)</i> forms include Uma, Gauri, Ambika, Parvati, Maheshvari, Lalita and Annapurna. As Rajarajeshvari (divine "Queen of kings") She is the presiding Deity of the Shri Chakra <i>yantra</i>. She is also worshiped as the ten Mahavidyas, manifestations of the highest knowledge -- Kali, Tara, Shodashi, Bhuvaneshvari, Chinnamasta, Bhairavi, Dhumavati, Bagata, Matangi and Kamala. While some Shaktas view these as individual beings, most revere them as manifestations of the singular Devi. There are also numerous minor Goddess forms, in the category of Gramadevata ("village Deity"). These include Pitari, "Snake-catcher" (usually represented by a simple stone), and Mariyamman, "Smallpox Goddess." In the <i>yoga</i> mysticism of all traditions, divine energy, <i>shakti,</i> is experienced within the human body in three aspects: 1) the feminine force, <i>ida shakti,</i> 2) the masculine force, <i>pingala shakti,</i> and 3) the pure androgynous force, <i>kundalini shakti,</i> that flows through the <i>sushumna nadi.</i> Shakti is most easily experienced by devotees as the sublime, bliss-inspiring energy that emanates from a holy person or sanctified Hindu temple.  </p>

<p class="word-entry">Shaktism (Shakta)</p>
<p class="definition">"Doctrine of power." The religion followed by those who worship the Supreme as the Divine Mother -- Shakti or Devi -- in Her many forms, both gentle and fierce. Shaktism is one of the four primary sects of Hinduism. Shaktism's first historical signs are thousands of female statuettes dated ca 5500 BCE recovered at the Mehrgarh village in India. In philosophy and practice, Shaktism greatly resembles Saivism, both faiths promulgating, for example, the same ultimate goals of <i>advaitic</i> union with Siva and <i>moksha</i>. But Shaktas worship Shakti as the Supreme Being exclusively, as the dynamic aspect of Divinity, while Siva is considered solely transcendent and is not worshiped. There are many forms of Shaktism, with endless varieties of practices which seek to capture divine energy or power for spiritual transformation. Geographically, Shaktism has two main forms, the Shrikula "family of the Goddess Shri (or Lakshmi)," which respects the <i>brahminical</i> tradition (a mainstream Hindu tradition which respects caste and purity rules) and is strongest in South India; and the Kalikula, "family of Kali," which rejects <i>brahminical</i> tradition and prevails in Northern and Eastern India. Four major expressions of Shaktism are evident today: folk-shamanism, <i>yoga,</i> devotionalism and universalism. Among the eminent <i>mantras</i> of Shaktism is: <i>Aum Hrim Chandikayai Namah,</i> "I bow to Her who tears apart all dualities." There are many varieties of folk Shaktism gravitating around various forms of the Goddess, such as Kali, Durga and a number of forms of Amman. Such worship often involves animal sacrifice and fire-walking, though the former is tending to disappear.  </p>

<p class="word-entry"><i>shruti</i></p>
<p class="definition">That which is "heard." Aurally, or clairaudiently, received scripture. Hinduism's revealed scriptures, of supreme theological authority and spiritual value. They are timeless teachings transmitted to <i>rishis</i>, or seers, directly by God thousands of years ago. <i>Shruti</i> is thus said to be <i>apaurusheya,</i> "supra-human." <i>Shruti</i> consists of the <i>Vedas</i> and the <i>Agamas</i>, preserved through oral tradition and eventually written down in Sanskrit. Among the many sacred books of the Hindus, these two bodies of knowledge are held in the highest esteem. For countless centuries <i>shruti</i> has been the basis of philosophical discussion, study and commentary, and this attention has given rise to countless schools of thought. It is also the subject of deep study and meditation, to realize the wisdom of the ancients within oneself. Most <i>mantras</i> are drawn from <i>shruti,</i> used for rites of worship, both public and domestic, as well as personal prayer and <i>japa.</i> It is a remarkable tribute to Hindu culture that so much of <i>shruti</i> was preserved without alteration by means of oral instruction from <i>guru</i> to <i>shishya,</i> generation after generation for thousands of years. In the <i>Veda</i> tradition this was accomplished by requiring the student to learn each verse in eleven different ways, including backwards. Traditionally <i>shruti</i> is not read, but chanted according to extremely precise rules of grammar, pitch, intonation and rhythm. This brings forth its greatest power. In the sacred language of <i>shruti,</i> word and meaning are so closely aligned that hearing these holy scriptures properly chanted is magical in its effect upon the soul of the listener.  </p>

<p class="word-entry">Siddha Siddhanta</p>
<p class="definition">Siddha Siddhanta, also called Gorakshanatha Saivism, is generally considered to have evolved in the lineage of the earlier ascetic orders of India. Its most well-known preceptor was Gorakshanatha (ca 1000) a disciple of Matsyendranatha, patron saint of Nepal, revered by certain esoteric Buddhist schools as well as by Hindus. The school systematized and developed the practice of <i>hatha yoga</i> to a remarkable degree. Indeed, nearly all of what is today taught about <i>hatha yoga</i> comes from this school. Among its central texts are <i>Hatha Yoga Pradipika</i> by Svatmarama, <i>Gheranda Samhita,</i> Sh<i>iva Samhita</i> and <i>Jnanamrita</i>. Siddha Siddhanta theology embraces both transcendent Siva (being) and immanent Siva (becoming). Siva is both the efficient and material cause of the universe. Devotion is expressed through temple worship and pilgrimage, with the central focus on internal worship and <i>kundalini yoga,</i> with the goal of realizing Parasamvid, the supreme transcendent state of Siva. Today there are perhaps 750,000 adherents of Siddha Siddhanta Saivism, who are often understood as Shaktas or <i>advaita tantrics.</i> The school fans out through India, but is most prominent in North India and Nepal. Devotees are called <i>yogis,</i> and stress is placed on world renunciation -- even for householders. This sect is most commonly known as Natha, the Gorakshapantha and Siddha Yogi Sampradaya. Other names include Adinatha Sampradaya, Nathamatha and Siddhamarga.  </p>

Through the repeated experience of Self Realization, <i>siddhis</i> naturally unfold according to the needs of the individual. Before Self Realization, the use or development of <i>siddhis</i> is among the greatest obstacles on the path because it cultivates <i>ahamkara, "</i>I-ness" (egoity), and militates against the attainment of <i>prapatti,</i> complete submission to the will of God, Gods and <i>guru.</i> Six <i>siddhis</i> in particular are considered primary obstacles to <i>samadhi:</i> clairvoyance <i>(adarsha siddhi</i> or <i>divya siddhi),</i> clairaudience <i>(shravana siddhi</i> or <i>divyashravana),</i> divination <i>(pratibha siddhi),</i> super-feeling (<i>vedana siddhi)</i> and super-taste <i>(asvadana siddhi),</i> super-smell <i>(varta siddhi).</i> The eight classical <i>siddhis</i> are: 1) <i>anima:</i> diminution; being as small as an atom; 2) <i>mahima:</i> enlargement; becoming infinitely large; 3) <i>laghima:</i> super-lightness, levitation; 4) <i>prapti:</i> pervasiveness, extension, ability to be anywhere at will; 5) <i>prakamya:</i> fulfillment of desires; 6) <i>vashitva:</i> control of natural forces; 7) <i>ishititva:</i> supremacy over nature; 8) <i>kama-avasayitva:</i> complete satisfaction. The supreme <i>siddhi (parasiddhi)</i> is realization of the Self, Parashiva.  </p>

<p class="word-entry">sin</p>
<p class="definition">Intentional transgression of divine law. Akin to the Latin <i>sons,</i> "guilty." Hinduism does not view sin as a crime against God, but as an act against <i>dharma</i> -- moral order -- and one's own self. It is thought natural, if unfortunate, that young souls act wrongly, for they are living in nescience, <i>avidya,</i> the darkness of ignorance. Sin is an <i>adharmic</i> course of action which automatically brings negative consequences. The term <i>sin</i> carries a double meaning, as do its Sanskrit equivalents: 1) a wrongful act, 2) the negative consequences resulting from a wrongful act. In Sanskrit the wrongful act is known by several terms, including <i>pataka</i> (from <i>pat,</i> "to fall"), <i>papa, enas</i>, <i>kilbisha</i>, <i>adharma, anrita</i> and <i>rina</i> (transgression, in the sense of omission). The residue of sin is called <i>papa</i>, sometimes conceived of as a sticky, astral substance which can be dissolved through penance <i>(prayashchitta),</i> austerity <i>(tapas)</i> and good deeds <i>(sukritya).</i> This astral substance can be psychically seen within the inner, subconscious aura of the individual. Note that <i>papa</i> is also accrued through unknowing or unintentional transgressions of <i>dharma,</i> as in the term <i>aparadha</i> (offense, fault, mistake). -- <b>inherent (or original) sin:</b> A doctrine of Semitic faiths whereby each soul is born in sin as a result of Adam's disobedience in the Garden of Eden. Sometimes mistakenly compared to the Saiva Siddhanta concept of the three <i>malas</i>, especially <i>anava.</i> See: <i>pasha.</i><b> -- mortal sin:</b> According to some theologies, sins so grave that they can hardly be expiated and which cause the soul to be condemned to suffer eternally in hell. In Hinduism, there are no such concepts as <i>inherent</i> or <i>mortal sin</i>. </p>

<p class="word-entry">Siva Advaita</p>
<p class="definition">Also called Siva Vishishtadvaita, or Saivite "qualified nondualism," Siva Advaita is the philosophy of Srikantha (ca 1050) as expounded in his commentary on the <i>Brahma Sutras</i> (ca 500-200 bce). Patterned after the Vaishnavite Vishishtadvaita of Ramanuja, this philosophy was later amplified by Appaya Dikshita. Brahman, or Siva, is transcendent and the efficient and material cause of the world and souls. Souls are not identical with Him and never merge in Him, even after liberation. As a school, Siva Advaita remained exclusively intellectual, never enjoying a following of practitioners. Purification, devotion and meditation upon Siva as the Self -- the <i>akasha</i> within the heart -- define the path. Meditation is directed to the Self, Siva, the One Existence that evolved into all form. Liberation depends on grace, not deeds.  </p>

Become attuned to the ever-present pulse of the universe, knowing that nothing moves but by His divine will. <b>All-PervasiveEnergy (shakti): </b>Become conscious of the flow of life within the body. Realize that it is the same universal energy within every living thing. Practice seeing the life energy within another's eyes. <b>Manifest Sacred Form</b> (darshana): Hold in your mind a sacred form, such as Nataraja, Sivalinga or the <i>satguru</i> -- who is Sadashiva -- and think of nothing else. See every form as a form of our God Siva. <b>Inner Light </b>(jyoti): Observe the light that illumines the thoughts. Concentrate only on that light, as you might practice being more aware of the light on a TV screen than of its changing pictures. <b>Sacred Sound</b> (nada): Listen to the constant high-pitched <i>ee</i> sounding in the head. It is like the tone of an electrical transformer, a hundred <i>tamburas </i>distantly playing or a humming swarm of bees.  </p>

<hr />
<p class="word-entry">Smartism</p>
<p class="definition">Sect based on the secondary scriptures <i>(smriti)</i>. The most liberal of the four major Hindu denominations, an ancient Vedic <i>brahminical</i> tradition (ca 700 BCE) which from the 9th century onward was guided and deeply influenced by the Advaita Vedanta teachings of the reformist Adi Sankara. Its adherents rely mainly on the classical <i>smriti</i> literature, especially the <i>Itihasas (Ramayana</i> and <i>Mahabharata,</i> the latter of which includes the <i>Bhagavad Gita)</i>, <i>Puranas</i> and <i>Dharma Shastras</i>. These are regarded as complementary to and a means to understanding the <i>Vedas.</i> Smartas adhere to Sankara's view that all Gods are but various representations of Saguna Brahman. Thus, Smartas are avowedly eclectic, worshiping all the Gods and discouraging sectarianism. The Smarta system of worship, called <i>panchayatana puja,</i> reinforces this outlook by including the major Deity of each primary Hindu sect of ancient days: Ganesha, Surya, Vishnu, Siva and Shakti. To encompass a sixth important lineage, Sankara recommended the addition of a sixth Deity, Kumara. Thus he was proclaimed <i>shanmata sthapanacharya,</i> founder of the sixfold system. One among the six is generally chosen as the devotee's preferred Deity, Ishta Devata. For spiritual authority, Smartas look to the regional monasteries established across India by Sankara, and to their pontiffs. These are the headquarters of ten orders of renunciate monks who spread the Advaita Vedanta teachings far and wide. Within Smartism three primary religious approaches are distinguished: ritualistic, devotional and philosophical.  </p>

<p class="definition">That which is "remembered;" the tradition. Hinduism's nonrevealed, secondary but deeply revered scriptures, derived from man's insight and experience. <i>Smriti</i> speaks of secular matters -- science, law, history, agriculture, etc. -- as well as spiritual lore, ranging from day-to-day rules and regulations to superconscious outpourings. 1) The term <i>smriti</i> refers to certain collections of ancient Sanskritic texts: the six or more <i>Vedangas,</i> the four <i>Upavedas,</i> the two <i>Itihasas,</i> and the 18 major <i>Puranas.</i> Among the <i>Vedangas,</i> the <i>Kalpa Vedanga</i> defines codes of ritual in the <i>Shrauta</i> and <i>Shulba Shastras,</i> and domestic-civil laws in the <i>Grihya</i> and <i>Dharma Shastras</i>. Also included as classical <i>smriti</i> are the founding <i>sutras</i> of six ancient philosophies called <i>shad darshana</i> (Sankhya, Yoga, Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Mimamsa and Vedanta). 2) In a general sense, <i>smriti</i> may refer to any text other than <i>shruti</i> (revealed scripture) that is revered as scripture within a particular sect. From the vast body of sacred literature, <i>shastra,</i> each sect and school claims its own preferred texts as secondary scripture, e.g., the <i>Ramayana</i> of Vaishnavism and Smartism, or the <i>Tirumurai</i> of Saiva Siddhanta. Thus, the selection of <i>smriti</i> varies widely from one sect and lineage to another.  </p>

<hr />
<p class="word-entry">soul</p>
<p class="definition">The real being of man, as distinguished from body, mind and emotions. The soul -- known as <i>atman</i> or <i>purusha</i> -- is the sum of its two aspects, the form or body of the soul and the essence of the soul (though many texts use the word <i>soul</i> to refer to the essence only). <b> -- essence or nucleus of the soul:</b> Man's innermost and unchanging being -- Pure Consciousness <i>(Parashakti</i> or <i>Satchidananda)</i> and Absolute Reality <i>(Parashiva)</i>. This essence was never created, does not change or evolve and is eternally identical with God Siva's perfections of Parashakti and Parashiva. <b> -- soul body:</b> <i>anandamaya</i> <i>kosha</i> ("sheath of bliss"), also referred to as the "causal body" <i>(karana</i> <i>sharira),</i> "innermost sheath" and "body of light." <i>Body of the soul,</i> or <i>soul body,</i> names the soul's manifest nature as an individual being -- an effulgent, human-like form composed of light (quantums). It is the emanational creation of God Siva, destined to one day merge back into Him. During its evolution, the soul functions through four types of outer sheaths that envelop the soul form -- mental, instinctive-intellectual, vital and physical -- and employs the mental faculties of <i>manas, buddhi</i> and <i>ahamkara,</i> as well as the five agents of perception <i>(jnanendriyas),</i> and five agents of action <i>(karmendriyas).</i> The "soul body" is not a body in sense of a case, a vessel, vehicle or enclosure for something else. The soul body is the soul itself -- a radiant, self-effulgent, human-like, super-intelligent being. Its very composition is Satchidananda in various subtle levels of manifestation. It is the finest of subatomic forms, on the quantum level. The soul form evolves as its consciousness evolves, becoming more and more refined until finally it is the same intensity or refinement as the Primal Soul, Parameshvara. The experiences of life, in all the various planes of consciousness, are "food for the soul," reaping lessons that actually raise the level of intelligence and divine love. Thus, very refined souls, whether embodied or in the disembodied, <i>ajiva,</i> state, are like walking intelligences with inventive creativeness and powers of preservation, beaming with love and luminosity in their self-effulgent bodies of quantum light particles. </p>

<p class="word-entry">soul body</p>
<p class="definition"><i>Anandamaya kosha</i> ("sheath of bliss"), also referred to as the "causal body" <i>(karana sharira),</i> "innermost sheath" and "body of light." <i>Body of the soul,</i> or <i>soul body,</i> names the soul's manifest nature as an individual being -- an effulgent, human-like form composed of light (quantums). It is the emanational creation of God Siva, destined to one day merge back into Him. During its evolution, the soul functions through four types of outer sheaths that envelope the soul form -- mental, instinctive-intellectual, vital and physical -- and employs the mental faculties of <i>manas, buddhi</i> and <i>ahamkara,</i> as well as the five agents of perception <i>(jnanendriyas)</i> and five agents of action <i>(karmendriyas).</i> The "soul body" is not a body in sense of a case, a vessel, vehicle or enclosure for something else. The soul body is the soul itself -- a radiant, self-effulgent, human-like, super-intelligent being. Its very composition is Satchidananda in various subtle levels of manifestation. It is the finest of subatomic forms, on the quantum level. The soul form evolves as its consciousness evolves, becoming more and more refined until finally it is the same intensity or refinement as the Primal Soul, Parameshvara. </p>

<p class="word-entry">sound</p>
<p class="definition"><i>Shabda.</i> As the <i>darshana,</i> or "seeing," of the Divine is a central article of faith for Hindus, similarly, <i>hearing</i> the Divine is spiritually indispensable. The ears are a center of many <i>nadis</i> connected to inner organs of perception. <i>Gurus</i> may when imparting initiation whisper in the ear of disciples to stimulate these centers and give a greater effect to their instructions. During temple <i>puja,</i> bells ring loudly, drums resound, conches and woodwinds blare to awaken worshipers from routine states of consciousness. Meditation on inner sound, called <i>nada anusandhana,</i> is an essential <i>yoga</i> practice. Listening to the <i>Vedas</i> or other scripture is a mystical process.

The very gradual expansion of consciousness as <i>kundalini shakti</i> slowly rises through the <i>sushumna.</i> The term <i>spiritual unfoldment</i> indicates this slow, imperceptible process, likened to a lotus flower's emerging from bud to effulgent beauty.

When philosophical training and <i>sadhana</i> is complete, the <i>kundalini</i> rises safely and imperceptibly, without jerks, twitches, tears or hot flashes. This brings greater willpower, compassion and perceptive qualities.  </p>

<p class="word-entry">Subramuniyaswami</p>
<p class="definition">162nd <i>satguru</i> (1927 -- 2001) of the Nandinatha Sampradaya's Kailasa Parampara. He was ordained Sivaya Subramuniyaswami by Sage Yogaswami on the full-moon day of May 12, 1949, in Jaffna, Sri Lanka, at 6:21pm. This was just days after he had attained <i>nirvikalpa samadhi</i> in the caves of Jalani. Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami is recognized worldwide as one of foremost Hindu ministers of our times, contributing to the revival of Hinduism in immeasurable abundance. He was simultaneously a staunch defender of traditions, as the tried and proven ways of the past, and a fearless innovator, setting new patterns of life for contemporary humanity. For a brief biography of this remarkable seer and renaissance <i>guru,</i> see "About the Author" on page 923 of <i>Dancing with Siva</i>. Gurudeva taught the traditional Saivite Hindu path to enlightenment, a path that leads the soul from simple service to worshipful devotion to God, from the disciplines of meditation and <i>yoga</i> to the direct knowing of Divinity within. His insights into the nature of consciousness provide a key for quieting the external mind and revealing to aspirants their deeper states of being, which are eternally perfect, full of light, love, serenity and wisdom. He urges all seekers to live a life of <i>ahimsa,</i> harmlessness towards nature, people and creatures, an ethic which includes vegetarianism. The name <i>Subramuniya</i> is a Tamil spelling of the Sanskrit <i>Shubhramunya</i> (not to be confused with <i>Subramanya).</i> It is formed from <i>shubhra</i> meaning "light; intuition," and <i>muni,</i> "silent sage." <i>Ya</i> means "restraint; religious meditation." Thus, <i>Subramuniya</i> means a self-restrained soul who remains silent or, when he speaks, speaks out from intuition.   </p>

Less refined cane sugar products, such as raw sugar, turbinado and sucanat (dried cane juice and molasses), make healthier alternatives.

<p class="word-entry">suicide</p>
<p class="definition">"Self-killing." In Sanskrit, <i>pranatyaga,</i> "abandoning life force." Intentionally ending one's own life through poisoning, drowning, burning, jumping, shooting, etc. Suicide has traditionally been condemned in Hindu scripture because, being an abrupt escape from life, it creates unseemly <i>karma</i> to face in the future. However, in cases of terminal disease or great disability, religious self-willed death through fasting -- <i>prayopavesha</i> -- is permitted. The person making such a decision declares it publicly, which allows for community regulation and distinguishes the act from suicide performed privately in traumatic emotional states of anguish and despair. Ancient lawgivers cite various stipulations: 1) inability to perform normal bodily purification; 2) death appears imminent or the condition is so bad that life's pleasures are nil; 3) the action must be done under community regulation. The gradual nature of <i>prayopavesha</i> is a key factor distinguishing it from sudden suicide, <i>svadehaghata</i> ("murdering one's body"), for it allows time for the individual to settle all differences with others, to ponder life and draw close to God, as well as for loved ones to oversee the person's gradual exit from the physical world. In the ideal, highly ritualized practice, one begins by obtaining forgiveness and giving forgiveness. Next a formal vow, <i>mahavrata-marana,</i> "great vow of death," is given to one's <i>guru,</i> following a full discussion of all <i>karmas</i> of this life, especially fully and openly confessing one's wrongdoings. Thereafter, attention is to be focused on scripture and the <i>guru's</i> noble teachings. Meditation on the innermost, immortal Self becomes the full focus as one gradually abstains from food. At the very end, as the soul releases itself from the body, the sacred <i>mantra</i> is repeated as instructed by the preceptor.  </p>

<p class="definition">The enlightenment path outlined in the Tantra scriptures. 1) Tantrism is sometimes considered a parallel stream of history and tradition in Hinduism, running alongside and gradually interweaving with the Vedic <i>brahminical</i> tradition. 2) Tantrism refers to traditions, mainly within Saivism and Shaktism, that focus on the arousal of the kundalini force and which view the human body as a vehicle of the Divine and an instrument for liberation. Tantrism's ultimate aim is a channeling of the kundalini life force through the <i>sushumna,</i> the gracious channel, upwards into the <i>sahasrara</i> chakra and beyond, through the door of Brahman <i>(brahmarandhra)</i> into Parashiva, either before or at the time of death. The stress is on the transformation of all spheres of consciousness, spiritual, psychic, emotional and material. It is a path of <i>sadhana.</i> 3) -- Shakta Tantrism: Brings a strong emphasis on the worship of the feminine force. Depending on the school, this may be symbolic or literal in rites involving sexual intercourse, etc. Shakta Tantrism's main principle is the use of the material to gain the spiritual. In certain schools, historically, this implies embracing that which is normally forbidden and manipulating the forces to attain transcendent consciousness rather than lower consciousness.  </p>

<p class="word-entry"><i>tapaha</i></p>
<p class="definition">The performance of purificatory spiritual disciplines, <i>sadhana,</i> penance, <i>tapas</i> and sacrifice; one of the <i>niyamas, </i>practices, in the <i>ashtanga yoga</i> system. <i>Tapaha</i> is from <i>tapas</i>, meaning "heat," or "fire," indicating the inner fire of transformation kindled by ascetic practices.  </p>

<hr />
<p class="word-entry"><i>tapas</i></p>
<p class="definition">"Heat, fire; ardor." 1) Purificatory spiritual disciplines, severe austerity, penance and sacrifice. The endurance of pain, suffering, through the performance of extreme penance, religious austerity and mortification. By comparison, <i>sadhana</i> is austerity of a simple, sustained kind, while <i>tapas</i> is austerity of a severe, psyche-transforming nature. <i>Tapas</i> is extreme bodily mortification, long-term <i>sadhanas,</i> such as meditating under a tree in one place for 12 years, taking a lifetime vow of silence and never speaking or writing, or standing on one leg for a prescribed number of years. Scriptures generally warn against extreme asceticism which would bring harm to the body. 2) On a deeper level, <i>tapas</i> is the intense inner state of <i>kundalini</i> "fire" which stimulates mental anguish and separates the individual from society. Life does not go on as usual when this condition occurs. The association with a <i>satguru,</i> Sadashiva, brings the devotee into <i>tapas,</i> and it brings him out of it. The fire of <i>tapas</i> burns on the dross of <i>sanchita karmas.</i> This is the source of heat, dismay, depression and striving until the advent of final and total surrender, <i>prapatti</i>. The individual can mollify this heated condition by continuing his regular <i>sadhana</i> as outlined by the <i>guru.</i> The fires of self-transformation may be stimulated by the practice of <i>tapas,</i> or come unbidden. One can "do" <i>tapas,</i> but the true <i>tapas</i> is a condition of being and consciousness which is a state of grace, bringing positive change, transformation and purification of one's nature. <i>Guru bhakti</i> is the only force that can cool the fires of <i>tapas.</i>  </p>

<p class="definition">"That-ness" or "essential nature." <i>Tattvas</i> are the primary principles, elements, states or categories of existence, the building blocks of the universe. Lord Siva constantly creates, sustains the form of and absorbs back into Himself His creations. <i>Rishis</i> describe this emanational process as the unfoldment of <i>tattvas,</i> stages or evolutes of manifestation, descending from subtle to gross. At <i>mahapralaya,</i> cosmic dissolution, they enfold into their respective sources, with only the first two <i>tattvas</i> surviving the great dissolution. The first and subtlest form -- the pure consciousness and source of all other evolutes of manifestation -- is called Siva <i>tattva,</i> or Parashakti-<i>nada.</i> But beyond Siva <i>tattva</i> lies Parashiva -- the utterly transcendent, Absolute Reality, called <i>attava</i>. That is Siva's first perfection. The Sankhya system discusses 25 <i>tattvas.</i> Saivism recognizes these same 25 plus 11 beyond them, making 36 <i>tattvas</i> in all. These are divided into three groups: 1) First are the five <i>shuddha</i> (pure) <i>tattvas.</i> These constitute the realm of <i>shuddha maya</i> 2) Next are the seven <i>shuddha-ashuddha</i> (pure-impure) <i>tattvas.</i> These constitute the realm of <i>shuddhashuddha maya.</i> 3) The third group comprises the 24 <i>ashuddha</i> (impure) <i>tattvas.</i> These constitute the realm of <i>ashuddha maya.</i> <b>THE SUDDHA TATTVAS:</b> <b>Actinic or spiritual energy.</b> This is the superconscious realm, also known as <i>shuddha</i> (pure) <i>maya</i> or <i>mahamaya. Bindu,</i> transcendent light, is the "material" cause of this pure sphere. This is the Sivaloka, the region of the 330 million Gods, the myriad <i>rishis</i> and other beings who have attained freedom from the triple bondage. 1) <b>Siva</b>  tattva: "auspiciousness," of two parts: the higher is Parashakti, "Supreme Energy," from which emerges primal sound, <i>nada</i> (more precisely Paranada, soundless sound). Though most often referred to as sound, <i>nada</i> is more mystically known as movement, the first impulse arising from perfect quiescence, the first "thing" out of the motionless Self. This is Siva's second perfection, Parashakti, superconsciousness, the mind of God. The Siva <i>tattva</i> pervades all other 35 categories and possesses the powers of will, knowledge and action <i>(icchha, jnana, kriya).</i> 2) <b>Shakti</b>  tattva: energy, corresponds to <i>bindu,</i> light, the cause of form (more precisely Parabindu, primal nucleus). This is the <i>tattva</i> of Parameshvara, the Primal Soul, father-mother God, Siva's third perfection, who after <i>mahapralaya</i> remains transfixed in deep <i>samadhi,</i> until He again emanates the universe through His Cosmic Dance. 3) <b>Sadashiva</b>  tattva: the power of revealing grace. In this realm the energies of knowledge and action are in perfect equilibrium. This is the realm of the <i>anandamaya kosha.</i> 4) <b>Ishvara</b>  tattva: the energy of concealment, concealing grace. The energy of action prevails over that of knowledge in order to arouse cosmic activity in its subtle form. 5) shuddhavidya tattva: pure knowledge, <i>dharma.</i> This is a level of manifestation in which the energy of action is in abeyance and the energy of knowledge prevails. <i>Shuddhavidya tattva</i> includes Siva's other three powers or aspects: Rudra (destruction), Vishnu (preservation) and Brahma (creation). -- <b>THE SUDDHASUDDHA TATTVAS:</b> <b>Actinodic, or spiritual-magnetic, energy.</b> The seven <i>tattvas</i> from <i>maya</i> to <i>purusha</i> make up the <i>shuddhashuddha</i> (pure-impure) realm. 6) maya tattva: mirific energy, the "material" cause of the "impure sphere." The category of <i>maya</i> brings into being as its immediate aids the following five <i>tattvas,</i> known as the "five sheaths," <i>pancha kanchuka,</i> of the individual soul, <i>purusha.</i> Collectively they make up the <i>vijnanamaya kosha,</i> or mental body. 7) kala tattva: the phenomenon of time, which divides all experience into past, present and future. 8) niyati tattva:<i> karmic</i> destiny; necessity; order; law of cause and effect; restraint. 9) kala tattva: creativity, aptitude, the power which draws the soul toward spiritual knowledge. Its energy partially removes the veil of <i>anava</i> which clouds the inherent powers of the soul. 10) vidya tattva: limited knowledge, the power which gives the soul practical knowledge in accord with its present life experiences. 11) raga tattva: attachment, the arousal of desire, without which no experience of the objective world is possible. 12) purusha tattva: soul identity; soul connected with subjectivity. Through identification with the five above "sheaths," the soul, <i>atman,</i> becomes a <i>purusha,</i> or bound soul, capable of experiencing the higher Antarloka as a limited individual. This fivefold sheath is called the <i>pancha kanchuka,</i> or <i>vijnanamaya kosha</i> (mental body). -- <b>THE ASUDDHA TATTVAS: Odic, or magnetic, energy. </b>These 24 categories make up the "world" of <i>ashuddha</i> (impure) <i>maya.</i> This is the realm of the astral and physical planes, in which souls function through the <i>manomaya, pranamaya</i> and <i>annamaya koshas,</i> depending on their level of embodiment. 13) prakriti tattva: primal nature, the gross energy of which all lower <i>tattvas</i> are formed. <i>Prakriti,</i> also called <i>pradhana,</i> is expressed as three <i>gunas</i> (qualities) -- <i>sattva, rajas</i> and <i>tamas.</i> These manifest as light, activity and inertia, respectively; and on the subtle level as pleasure, sorrow and delusion. These <i>gunas</i> dominate the soul's powers of knowledge, action and desire <i>(jnana,</i> <i>kriya</i> and <i>icchha),</i> and form the <i>guna</i> body, <i>manomaya kosha</i>. <i>-- antahkarana:</i> the mental faculty. 14) buddhi tattva: judgment, intellect, the faculty of discrimination. 15) ahamkara tattva: egoism, sense of I-ness in the external form. It is the fundamental principle of individuality. 16) manas tattva: the instinctive mind, the receiving and directing link between the outer senses and the inner faculties.  <i>-- jnanendriya:</i> the five cognitive senses, of the nature of <i>sattva guna.</i> Each has a subtle and physical aspect. 17) shrotra tattva: hearing (ears). 18) tvak tattva: touching (skin). 19) chakshu tattva: seeing (eyes). 20) rasana tattva: tasting (tongue). 21) ghrana tattva: smelling (nose).  <i>-- karmendriya:</i> the five organs of action, of the nature of <i>raja guna.</i> Each has a subtle and physical aspect. 22) vak tattva: speech <i>(</i>voice). 23) pani tattva: grasping (hands). 24) pada tattva: walking (feet). 25) payu tattva: excretion (anus). 26) upastha tattva: procreation (genitals).  <i>-- tanmatra:</i> the five subtle elements, of the nature of <i>tamaguna.</i> 27) shabda tattva: sound. 28) sparsha tattva: feel. 29) rupa tattva: form. 30) rasa tattva: taste. 31) gandha tattva: odor. These are the subtle characteristics of the five gross elements, <i>akasha, vayu, tejas, apas</i> and <i>prithivi,</i> respectively. <i>-- panchabhuta:</i> the five gross elements. 32) akasha tattva: ether or space. 33) vayu tattva: air. 34) tejas tattva: fire. 35) apas tattva <i>(</i>or <i>jala):</i> water. 36) prithivi tattva: earth. </p>

<p class="word-entry">three worlds</p>
<p class="definition">The three worlds of existence, <i>triloka,</i> are the primary hierarchical divisions of the cosmos. 1) Bhuloka: "Earth world," the physical plane. 2) Antarloka: "Inner or in-between world," the subtle or astral plane. 3) Sivaloka: "World of Siva," and of the Gods and highly evolved souls; the causal plane, also called Karanaloka. The three-world cosmology is readily found in Hindu scriptures. In the major <i>Upanishads</i> of the <i>Vedas</i> we find numerous instances, with interesting variations. Verse 1.5.17 of the <i>Brihadaranyaka Upanishad</i> states, "Now, there are, verily, three worlds, the world of men (Manushyaloka), the world of the fathers (Pitriloka) and the world of the Gods (Devaloka)..." Later, verse 6.2.15 refers to the two higher worlds as the Devaloka and the Brahmaloka. The <i>Katha Upanishad,</i> verse 2.3.8, omitting the world of men, lists the Pitriloka, the Gandharvaloka (world of genies or elementals) and the Brahmaloka (world of God). Another perspective of three worlds is offered in the Prashna <i>Upanishad</i> 3.8, which lists the world of good (Punyaloka), the world of evil (Papaloka) and the world of men (Manushyaloka). Scriptures offer several other cosmological perspectives, most importantly seven upper worlds <i>(sapta urdhvaloka)</i> and seven lower worlds <i>(sapta adholoka)</i>, which correspond to the 14 <i>chakras</i> and make up the "world-egg of God," the universe, called <i>Brahmanda.</i> The seven upper worlds are Bhuloka, Bhuvarloka, Svarloka, Maharloka, Janaloka, Tapoloka and Satyaloka. The second, third and fourth comprise the subtle plane. The highest three comprise the causal plane. The seven lower worlds, collectively known as Naraka or Patala, are (from highest to lowest) Put, Avichi, Samhata, Tamisra, Rijisha, Kudmala and Kakola. From the Saiva Agamic perspective of the 36 <i>tattvas,</i> the pure sphere, <i>shuddha maya</i> -- the first five <i>tattvas</i> -- is subdivided into 33 planes of existence. The "pure-impure" realm, <i>shuddhashuddha maya</i> -- the seven <i>tattvas</i> from <i>maya tattva</i> to <i>purusha</i> -- contains 27 planes of existence. The <i>ashuddha</i> ("impure") <i>realm</i> -- of 24 <i>tattvas</i> -- has 56 planes of existence.  </p>

<p class="definition">"Holy couplets." A treasury of Hindu ethical insight and a literary masterpiece of the Tamil language, written by Saiva Saint Tiruvalluvar (ca 200 BCE) near present-day Chennai. Its nonsectarian wisdom has been adopted by Christians, Muslims, Jains and even atheists. The text focuses primarily on the first three goals of life -- <i>artha</i> (wealth), <i>dharma</i> (conduct) and <i>kama</i> (desire) -- but also includes 13 chapters on renunciate <i>dharma,</i> relating to life's fourth goal, <i>moksha</i> (liberation). In an extraordinarily compact verse form of 14 syllables, the poet presents 133 subjects of ten verses each on relationships, human strengths and foibles, statecraft and more.

<p class="word-entry"><i>Tirumantiram</i></p>
<p class="definition">"Holy incantation." The Nandinatha Sampradaya's oldest Tamil scripture; written ca 200 BCE by Rishi Tirumular. It is the earliest of the <i>Tirumurai</i> texts, and a vast storehouse of esoteric <i>yogic</i> and <i>tantric</i> knowledge. It contains the mystical essence of <i>raja yoga</i> and <i>siddha yoga,</i> and the fundamental doctrines of the 28 <i>Saiva Siddhanta Agamas</i>, which are the heritage of the ancient pre-historic traditions of Saivism. As the <i>Agamas</i> themselves are now partially lost, the <i>Tirumantiram</i> is a rare source of the complete <i>Agamanta</i> (collection of Agamic lore). Its 3,047 verses were, as legend has it, composed in a rather extraordinary way. Before writing each verse, Tirumular would meditate for an entire year, then summarize his meditation in a four-line Tamil verse. He did this for 3,000 years! The allegory is said to mean that 3,000 years of knowledge is compacted in this one book. The text is organized in nine parts, called <i>tantras,</i> summarized as follows: 1) basic rules of religious morality; 2) allegorical explanations of Saiva mythological stories; five powers of Siva, three classifications of souls; 3) a complete treatise on <i>raja yoga</i>; 4) <i>mantras</i> and <i>tantras;</i> 5) the essential features of the Saiva religion; the four forms of Saivism, four stages, unorthodox paths, conduct to be avoided; 6) the Sivaguru, grace, renunciation, sin, penance, <i>jnana,</i> worthy and unworthy persons; 7) <i>siddha yoga,</i> more on grace, <i>mudras,</i> control of <i>ida</i> and <i>pingala,</i> worlds reached by different classes of <i>yogis</i> after death, refinements of <i>yoga,</i> the <i>satguru;</i> 8) essential theology: five sheaths, eleven states, three <i>padarthas</i> (Pati-pashu-pasha), 36 <i>tattvas,</i> four states of consciousness, three <i>malas,</i> three <i>gunas,</i> ten <i>karanas,</i> etc.; 9) the fruits of realization, liberation, <i>jnana,</i> Siva's dances, meeting of the <i>guru.</i>  </p>

The 658 hymns of <i>Tiruvasagam</i> together with the 400 hymns of <i>Tirukovaiyar</i> by the same author make up the eighth <i>Tirumurai</i> of Saiva Siddhanta scripture.  </p>

<p class="word-entry">tithe (tithing)</p>
<p class="definition">The spiritual discipline, often a <i>vrata,</i> of giving one tenth of one's gainful and gifted income to a religious organization of one's choice, thus sustaining spiritual education and upliftment on Earth. The Sanskrit equivalent is <i>dashamamsha,</i> called <i>makimai</i> in the Tamil tradition. Tithing is given not as an offering, but as "God's money." In olden days it was a portion of one's crops, such as one coconut out of ten. Immediately setting aside the tithe as soon as income is received sanctifies the remaining portion and reaps the greatest <i>punya.</i> It is an acknowledgement by faithful Hindus of God's providential care, bringing a greater awareness of God's power in the world. Because tithers are thus uplifted to a purer, spiritual consciousness, abundance naturally floods into their lives. Additional offerings should be given after this minimal obligation is paid.  </p>

<hr />
<p class="word-entry"><i>tithi</i></p>
<p class="definition">A lunar day, approximately one-thirtieth of the time it takes the moon to orbit the Earth. Because of their means of calculation (based on the difference of the longitudinal angle between the position of sun and the moon), <i>tithis</i> may vary in length. There are 15 <i>tithis</i> in each fortnight (half month). The names of the <i>tithis</i> are Prathama (new moon), Dvitiya, Tritiya, Chaturthi, Panchami, Shashthi, Saptami, Ashtami, Navami, Dashami, Ekadashi, Dvadashi, Trayodashi, Chaturdashi, and lastly either Purnima (full moon) or Amavasya (new moon). These are sometimes prefixed to indicate either the dark <i>(krishna)</i> fortnight -- when the moon is waning -- or the light <i>(shukla)</i> fortnight -- when the moon is waxing -- e.g., Shukla-Navami. Most Hindu festivals are calculated according to the <i>tithis.</i>   </p>

<p class="word-entry">trance</p>
<p class="definition">In general, a condition of altered consciousness, accompanied by a lack of awareness to physical surroundings, neither a state of wakefulness nor sleep. In a religious sense it is a state of intense concentration, introspection or meditation. In such a state, called <i>samadhi,</i> body consciousness is completely lost as the energies are drawn up the spine into the <i>sahasrara chakra</i> at the crown of the head. Great prophets have gone into trance and spoken out predictions of the future and in their waking state later had no memory of what they had said. In spiritualism, trance describes the phenomenon in which an individual leaves the physical body, and a disincarnate being enters or takes control of the body, often giving forth verbal messages to others in attendance, as in a seance. Trance can be either voluntary or involuntary.  </p>

<p class="word-entry">transmutation</p>
<p class="definition">Change from one form to another. Here, changing or transforming the sexual/instinctive energies into intellectual and spiritual ones. <i>Transmutation </i>means to reverse the forces that constantly flow from the <i>sahasrara</i> downward into the <i>muladhara</i>. It is lifting the force of sexual impulses that would tend to manifest in visualization, longing for affection and sensual feelings, often leading to masturbation and loss of the sacred fluids. One exception, for both men and women, is the occurrence of wet dreams,for here the astral, psychic vitality of the actinodic rises as the odic fluids are released. However, night emissions are to be controlled and may be minimized or eliminated by taking only liquid or light foods in the evening.Swami Sivananda discusses wet dreams in his <i>Yoga Lessons for Children,</i> chapter 36 on <i>brahmacharya:</i> "Many young boys and men suffer from wet dreams. Sri Aurobindo states that an occurrence once a week is normal. To have it more frequently indicates indulgence in sex thoughts." Sivananda advises a <i>sattvic</i> diet, rising early (as wet dreams usually occur in the last quarter of the night), cold showers, <i>hatha yoga,</i> fresh fruit and raw foods, and not going to bed right after a heavy meal. He writes, "The actual essence does not come out during wet dreams. It is only the watery prostatic juice, with a little semen. When nocturnal emission takes place, the mind which was working in the inner astral body suddenly enters the physical body vehemently in an agitated condition. That is the reason why emission takes place suddenly." He concludes, "Do not get depressed or anxious. It is best not to give too much importance to these dreams. Forget them, then they will not trouble you." Monks enhance transmutation by not eating after high noon, not viewing pornography, not mentally conjuring up sexually stimulating images, never joking or talking about sexuality and, of course, not flirting or interacting sensually with women or men. If sexual energies are aroused or one has erred from his disciplines, he performs the appropriate penance (such as fasting) or <i>tantra</i> (such as <i>pranayama</i>) to correct the matter. The <i>Tirumantiram</i> (verse 1948) states, "If the sacred seed is retained, life does not ebb; great strength, energy, intelligence and alertness: all these are attained."  </p>

Traditionally, the number of <i>Upanishads</i> is given as 108.

<p class="word-entry">Vaishnavism (Vaishnava)</p>
<p class="definition">One of the four major religions, or denominations of Hinduism, representing roughly half of the world's one billion Hindus. It gravitates around the worship of Lord Vishnu as Personal God, His incarnations and their consorts. The doctrine of <i>avatara </i>(He who descends), especially important to Vaishnavism, teaches that whenever <i>adharma</i> gains ascendency in the world, God takes a human birth to reestablish "the way." There are either 10, 22 or 34 <i>avataras</i> of Vishnu, according to various scriptures. The most renowned <i>avataras</i> were Rama and Krishna. The last to come will be Kalki, the harbinger of a golden age on Earth. Vaishnavism stresses the personal aspect of God over the impersonal, and <i>bhakti</i> (devotion) as the true path to salvation. The goal of Vaishnavism is the attainment of <i>mukti</i>, defined as blissful union with God's body, the loving recognition that the soul is a part of Him, and eternal nearness to Him in Vaikuntha, heaven. Foremost among Vaishnava scriptures are the <i>Vaishnava Agamas, Bhagavad Gita</i> and <i>Bhagavata Purana.</i> Among the earliest schools were the Pancharatras and the Bhagavatas. The five major contemporary schools (founded between 1000 and 1500) are those of Ramanuja (Shri Vaishnavism), Madhva, Nimbarka, Vallabha and Chaitanya. Philosophically they range from Madhva's pure dualism to Vallabha's lofty monistic vision.   </p>

<p class="word-entry"><i>vak</i></p>
<p class="definition">"Speech." Theologically, it is through the supreme Vak (or Paravak), the "Primal Word" of the <i>Vedas</i>, and its various aspects, that creation issues forth. Vak, the word, is said to descend in four cosmic steps or levels: <i>mahakarana,</i> the great causal; <i>karana,</i> the causal, the mind principle; <i>sukshma,</i> the vital life force; and <i>sthula,</i> physical matter. These correspond to the four states, <i>avasthas,</i> of consciousness: <i>jagrat,</i> wakefulness; <i>svapna,</i> dreaming; <i>sushupti,</i> deep sleep; and <i>turiya,</i> the fourth. Related to the human microcosm in the <i>tantrika</i> tradition, <i>vak </i>is correlated to the chakras. Paravak, the great causal, <i>mahakarana,</i> is said to center in the base of the spinal column in the <i>muladhara</i> chakra, the abode of Ganapati as Brahmanaspati, Master of the Word<i>. Pasyanti vak,</i> "the word that perceives," is located in the navel center, <i>manipura</i> chakra<i>.</i> <i>Madhyama vak,</i> the intermediate word, is centered between the navel and the throat, from whence speech, <i>vaikhari vak,</i> is expressed. Ganapati as Brahmanaspati is the Master of the Word, the Lord of Satya Mantra. And so, the <i>Tantra</i> conceives Him having His abode in the <i>muladhara</i> of beings, from where speech originates in the form of Paravak. </p>

<p class="word-entry"><i>varna</i> dharma</p>
<p class="definition">"The way of one's kind." The hereditary social class system, generally referred to as <i>caste,</i> established in India in ancient times<i>.</i> Within <i>varna dharma</i> are the many religious and moral codes which define human virtue. <i>Varna dharma</i> is social duty, in keeping with the principles of good conduct, according to one's community, which is generally based on the craft or occupation of the family. Strictly speaking it encompasses two interrelated social hierarchies: 1) <i>varna,</i> which refers to the four classes: brahmin, kshatriya, vaishya and shudra; and 2<i>) jati,</i> the myriad occupational subgroups, or guilds, which in India number over 3,000. Hence this dharma is sometimes called <i>jati</i> dharma<i>.</i> The class-caste system is still very much a part of Indian life today. Many modern Hindus propose that social status is now (and was originally) more properly determined by a person's skills and accomplishments than by birth. Mobility between <i>jatis,</i> or castes, within Hindu communities worldwide is limited but not impossible, and is accomplished through marrying into a new <i>jati,</i> or changing professions through persistence, skill and education. <i>Shastris</i> say that once a person breaks out of his <i>varna</i> or <i>jati</i> of birth and changes "caste," it takes three generations for his family to become fully established in that new strata of society, provided the continuity is unbroken. The <i>varna dharma</i> system -- despite its widespread discrimination against <i>harijans,</i> and the abuse of social status by higher castes -- ensures a high standard of craftsmanship, a sense of community belonging, family integrity and religio-cultural continuity. Caste is not unique to Hinduism and India. By other names it is found in every society. The four <i>varnas,</i> or classes, and myriad <i>jatis,</i> occupational castes, or guilds, form the basic elements of human interaction. </p>

The <i>Samhitas</i> and <i>Brahmanas</i> (together known as the <i>karmakanda,</i> "ritual section") affirm a transcendent-immanent Supreme-Being cosmology and a system of worship through fire ceremony and chanting devotional hymns to establish communication with the Gods. The <i>Aranyakas</i> and <i>Upanishads</i> (the <i>jnanakanda,</i> "knowledge section") outline the soul's evolutionary journey, providing <i>yogic</i>-philosophic training and propounding a lofty, nondual realization as the destiny of all souls.

<p class="word-entry">Vedanta</p>
<p class="definition">"Ultimate wisdom" or "final conclusions of the <i>Vedas."</i> Vedanta is the system of thought embodied in the <i>Upanishads</i> (ca 1500-600 BCE), which give forth the ultimate conclusions of the <i>Vedas</i>. Through history there developed numerous Vedanta schools, ranging from pure dualism to absolute monism. The Vedanta perspective elucidated in <i>Dancing with Siva</i> is Advaita Ishvaravada, "monistic theism" or panentheism, exemplified in the Vedanta-Siddhanta of Rishi Tirumular (ca 250 BCE) of the Nandinatha Sampradaya in his <i>Tirumantiram,</i> which is a perfect summation of both the <i>Vedas</i> and the <i>Agamas</i>. This is a dipolar reconciliation of monism and dualism which, as philosopher-statesman Dr. S. Radhakrishnan (1888 -- 1975) declared, best describes the philosophy of the <i>Upanishads</i>. After ca 700 CE, many other schools evolved, each establishing itself through written commentaries on the major <i>Upanishads,</i> the <i>Bhagavad Gita</i> and the <i>Brahma Sutras</i>. The latter text, by Badarayana (ca 400 BCE), is the earliest known systematization of Vedanta, but its extremely terse aphorisms are philosophically cryptic without commentary. During the "scholastic era" (700 -- 1700), three main variations of the original Vedanta were developed: 1) Advaita Vedanta, or pure nondualism, exemplified by Sankara (788 -- 820); 2) Vishishtadvaita Vedanta, or qualified nondualism, most fully expressed by Ramanuja (1017 -- 1137); and 3) Dvaita Vedanta, expounded by Madhva (1197 -- 1278). Panentheism is embodied in those qualified nondual Vedanta schools that accept the ultimate identity of the soul and God. Examples are the Vishishtadvaita of Bhaskara (ca 950), the Shuddha Advaita, "pure nondualism," of Vallabha (ca 1475 -- 1530) and, to a lesser degree, the Vishishtadvaita of Ramanuja. In summary: Madhva, the dualist, conceives Brahman to be the Personal God. In his philosophy, the universe, souls and God are all separate from one another and real. Ramanuja, the qualified nondualist, also conceives Brahman to be the Personal God. In his philosophy, God must not be considered apart from the world and souls, for the three together form a one whole. The world and souls are real as the body of God, and the individual soul feels himself to be part of God. Sankara, the strict <i>advaitist,</i> conceives Brahman to be the Impersonal God, the Absolute. Sankara does not deny the existence of the Personal God, known as Ishvara, but declares Ishvara to be equally as unreal as the universe and the individuality of the soul. In truth, the only Reality is the Absolute, and man <i>is</i> that Absolute. To Rishi Tirumular, the panentheist, there is an eternal oneness of God and man at the level of their inner Being, but a difference is acknowledged during the evolution of the soul. Ultimately even this difference merges in identity. Thus, there is perfectly beginningless oneness and a temporary difference which resolves itself in perfect identity. <i>Vedanta</i> is one of the six classical philosophies <i>(shad darshanas)</i> along with Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Sankhya, Yoga and Mimamsa. Vedanta is also called Uttara Mimamsa, "upper or later examination," as distinguished from Purva Mimamsa, which concerned itself solely with the earlier portions of the <i>Veda.</i> Other important schools of Vedanta include the Dvaitadvaita, "dual-nondualism,"of Nimbarka (ca 1150), and the Achintya Bhedabheda, "unthinkable difference-nondifference," of Chaitanya (1485 -- 1534).  </p>

<p class="word-entry"><i>Vedas</i></p>
<p class="definition">"Wisdom." Composed 1500-500 b.c.e., four companion scriptures--<i>Rig, Yajur, Sama, Atharva</i>--consisting of roughly 20,000 Sanskrit verses that form Hinduism's primary scripture (along with the <i>Agamas).</i> Transmitted to man from God Siva and the Gods through the superconscious faculties of the rishis, the Veda are <i>sruti,</i> "that which is heard." Because the mystic knowledge described in the <i>Vedas</i> cannot be experienced through man's intellect, these scriptures are considered superconscious wisdom. Originally, the <i>Vedas</i> were passed down orally, only taking written form centuries after their inception. Each <i>Veda</i> is comprised of four sections: <i>Samhitas, Brahmanas, Aranyakas </i>and <i>Upanishads. </i>The <i>Samhitas</i> and <i>Brahmanas</i> detail a transcendent/immanent Supreme Being cosmology and a system of worship through fire ceremony and chanting to establish communication with the Gods. The <i>Aranyakas </i>and <i>Upanishads </i>outline the soul's evolutionary journey, provide yogic/philosophic training and propound a lofty, non-dual realization as the destiny of all souls.   </p>

This is reflected in the fact that while the <i>Vedas</i> are voiced by <i>rishis,</i> God or the Goddess is the bestower of truth in the <i>Agama</i> texts. </p>

<p class="word-entry">Vira Saivism (Saiva)</p>
<p class="definition">"Heroic Saivism." Made prominent by Basavanna in the 12th century. Also called Lingayat Saivism. Followers, called Lingayats, Lingavantas or Sivasharanas, always wear a Sivalinga on their person. Vira Saivites are proudly egalitarian and emphasize the personal relationship with Siva, rather than temple worship. Vira Saiva priests, <i>jangamas,</i> conduct marriages and other domestic rites and also act as <i>gurus</i> or teachers. Among the most central texts are Basavanna's <i>Vachanas,</i> Allama Prabhu's <i>Mantragopya,</i> Chennabasavanna's <i>Karana Hasuge,</i> and the collected work called <i>Shunya Sampadane.</i> The monistic-theistic doctrine of Vira Saivism is called Shakti Vishishtadvaita -- a version of qualified nondualism which accepts both difference and nondifference between soul and God, like rays are to the sun. In brief, Siva and the cosmic force or existence are one ("Siva are you; you shall return to Siva."). Yet, Siva is beyond His creation, which is real, not illusory. God is both efficient and material cause. In Vira Saivism, Siva divides from His Absolute state into Linga (Supreme Lord) and <i>anga,</i> individual soul, the two eventually reuniting in undifferentiated oneness. There are three aspects of Sivalinga. 1) Ishtalinga, personal form of Siva, in which He fulfills desires and removes afflictions -- God as bliss or joy; 2) Bhavalinga, Siva beyond space and time, the highest divine principle, knowable through intuition; 3) Pranalinga, the reality of God which can be apprehended by the mind. The soul merges with Siva by a progressive, six-stage path called <i>shatsthala</i>, consisting of <i>bhakti</i> (devotion), <i>mahesha</i> (charity and selfless service), <i>prasada</i> (seeking Siva's grace), Pranalinga (experience of all as Siva), <i>sharana</i> (egoless refuge in Siva) and <i>aikya</i> (oneness with Siva). Today Vira Saivism is a vibrant faith, particularly strong in its religious homeland of Karnataka, South Central India. Roughly 40 million people live here, of which perhaps 25% are members of the Vira Saiva religion. Early on, they rejected <i>brahminical</i> authority, and along with it the entire caste system and the <i>Vedas</i>. By rejecting the <i>Vedas,</i> they continue to stand outside mainstream Hinduism, but in their profound love of Siva and acceptance of certain <i>Saiva Agamas,</i> as well as the main truths of the Vedic wisdom, they have identified themselves as a unique Saiva sect. Though they have established their faith as a distinct and independent religion in Indian courts of law, they are still widely embraced as devout brothers and sisters of the Hindu <i>dharma.</i>  </p>

Best known as the term used by Ramanuja (ca 1017-1137) to name his Vaishnava Vedanta philosophy, which is nondualistic in that the ultimate truth or reality is one, not two, and souls are in fact part of God. And it is "qualified" in that souls are <i>fully</i> one with God, but not identical. Thus there is a full union which is somewhat shy of total merger. <i>Siva Vishishtadvaita</i> was the term chosen by Bhaskara (ca 950) to name his philosophy.  </p>

<p class="word-entry"><i>vishvagrasa</i></p>
<p class="definition">"Total absorption." The final merger, or absorption, of the soul in Siva, by His grace, at the fulfillment of its evolution. It is the ultimate union of the individual soul body with the body of Siva --Parameshvara -- within the Sivaloka, from whence the soul was first emanated. This occurs at the end of the soul's evolution, after the four outer sheaths -- <i>annamaya kosha, pranamaya kosha, manomayakosha</i> and <i>vijnamaya kosha --</i> have been discarded. Finally, <i>anandamaya kosha,</i> the soul form itself, merges in the Primal Soul. Individuality is lost as the soul becomes Siva, the Creator, Preserver, Destroyer, Veiler and Revealer. Individual identity expands into universality. Having previously merged in Parasiva and Parashakti in states of <i>samadhi,</i> the soul now fully merges into Parameshvara and is one with all three of Siva's perfections. <i>Jiva</i> has totally become Siva -- not a new and independent Siva, as might be construed, for there is and can only be one Supreme God Siva. This fulfilled merger can happen at the moment the physical body is abandoned, or after eons of time following further unfoldment of the higher <i>chakras</i> in the inner worlds, all depending on the maturity, ripeness and intentions of the soul, by which is meant the advanced soul's choice to be either an <i>upadeshi</i> or a <i>nirvani.</i>  </p>

Swami Sivananda discusses wet dreams in his <i>Yoga Lessons for Children, Chapter 36 on Brahmacharya.</i> He states, "Many young boys and men suffer from wet dreams. Sri Aurobindo states that an occurrence once a week is normal. To have it more frequently indicates indulgence in sex thoughts." Sivananda advises a sattvic diet, rising early (as wet dreams usually occur in the last quarter of the night), cold showers, <i>hatha yoga,</i> fresh fruit and raw foods, not going to bed right after a heavy meal. He says, "The actual essence does not come out during wet dreams. It is only the watery prostatic juice with a little semen. When nocturnal emission takes place, the mind which was working in the inner astral body suddenly enters the physical body vehemently in an agitated condition. That is the reason why emission takes place suddenly." He concludes, "Do not get depressed or anxious. It is best not to give too much importance to these dreams. Forget them, then they will not trouble you." </p>

<p class="word-entry"><i>yajna</i></p>
<p class="definition">"Worship; sacrifice." One of the most central Hindu concepts -- sacrifice and surrender through acts of worship, inner and outer. 1<b>) </b>A form of ritual worship especially prevalent in Vedic times, in which oblations -- <i>ghee,</i> grains, spices and exotic woods -- are offered into a fire according to scriptural injunctions while special <i>mantras</i> are chanted. The element fire, <i>Agni,</i> is revered as the divine messenger who carries offerings and prayers to the Gods. The ancient <i>Veda Brahmanas</i> and the <i>Shrauta Shastras</i> describe various types of <i>yajna</i> rites, some so elaborate as to require hundreds of priests, whose powerful chanting resounds for miles. These major <i>yajnas</i> are performed in large, open-air structures called <i>yagashala.</i> Domestic <i>yajnas</i>, prescribed in the <i>Grihya Shastras,</i> are performed in the family compound or courtyard<i>. Yajna</i> requires four components, none of which may be omitted: <i>dravya,</i> sacrificial substances; <i>tyaga,</i> the spirit of sacrificing all to God; <i>devata,</i> the celestial beings who receive the sacrifice; and <i>mantra,</i> the empowering word or chant. While <i>puja</i> (worship in temples with water, lights and flowers) has largely replaced the <i>yajna,</i> this ancient rite still continues, and its specialized priestly training is carried on in schools in India. <i>Yajnas</i> on a grand scale are performed for special occasions, beseeching the Gods for rain during drought, or for peace during bloody civil war. Even in temples, <i>yajna</i> has its Agamic equivalent in the <i>agnikaraka,</i> the <i>homa</i> or <i>havana</i> ceremony, held in a fire pit <i>(homakunda)</i> in an outer <i>mandapa</i> of a temple as part of elaborate <i>puja</i> rites. 2) Personal acts of worship or sacrifice. Life itself is a jivayajna. The <i>Upanishads</i> suggest that one can make "inner <i>yajnas</i>" by offering up bits of the little self into the fires of <i>sadhana</i> and <i>tapas</i> until the greater Self shines forth. The five daily <i>yajnas,</i> pancha mahayajna, of the householder (outlined in the <i>Dharma Shastras)</i> ensure offerings to <i>rishis,</i> ancestors, Gods, creatures and men. </p>

The contents of these two recensions are also presented in different order. The <i>Yajur Veda Samhita</i> is divided into 40 chapters and contains 1,975 stanzas. About 30 percent of the stanzas are drawn from the <i>Rig Veda Samhita</i> (particularly from chapters eight and nine). This <i>Veda</i> is a special collection of hymns to be chanted during <i>yajna</i>. The <i>Krishna Yajur Veda Samhita</i> exists today in various recensions, most importantly the <i>Taittiriya Samhita</i> and the <i>Maitrayani Samhita.</i> The <i>Shukla Yajur Veda Samhita</i> is preserved most prominently as the <i>Vajasaneyi Samhita.</i>  </p>

<p class="word-entry"><i>yuga</i></p>
<p class="definition">"Eon," "age." A time span, from tens of thousands to one million years, which is a single cycle within a four-yuga greater cycle. The four yugas are: Satya (or Krita), Treta, Dvapara and Kali. In the first period, <i>dharma</i> reigns supreme, but as the ages revolve, virtue diminishes and ignorance and injustice increases. At the end of the Kali Yuga, in which we are now, the cycle begins again with a new Satya Yuga. It is said in the <i>Mahabharata</i> that during the Satya Yuga all are <i>brahmins,</i> and the color of this <i>yuga</i> is white. In the Treta Yuga, righteousness decreases by one-fourth and men seek reward for their rites and gifts; the color is red and the consciousness of the <i>kshatriya,</i> sovereignty, prevails. In the Dvapara Yuga, the four <i>varnas</i> come fully into existence. The color is yellow. In the Kali Yuga, the color is black. Righteousness is one-tenth that of the Satya Yuga. True worship and sacrifice cease, and base, or <i>shudra,</i> consciousness is prominent. Calamities, disease, fatigue and faults such as anger and fear prevail. People decline and their motives grow weak.  </p>

<p class="definition">Of or related to Zoroastrianism, a religion founded in Persia by Spenta Zarathustra (ca 600 BCE). It has roughly 150,000 adherents today, mostly near Mumbai, where they are called Parsis. The faith stresses monotheism while recognizing a universal struggle between the force of good (led by Ahura Mazda) and evil (led by Ahriman). The sacred fire, always kept burning in the home, is considered the only worshipful symbol. Scripture is the <i>Zend Avesta.</i>   </p>
