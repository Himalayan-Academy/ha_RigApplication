</h1>

<h3>1. Guided Study</h3>

<img class="float-right" src="/html/livespiritually/become-student/img/trilogy-spines.jpg" alt="The Master Course Trilogy" />

<p>
Himalayan Academy's Guided Master Course Study is more than an intellectual learning of new information about Hindu philosophy and practice. Its primary focus is to practice the teachings throughout the day. As the lessons explain in detail, it is this practical application of the spiritual teachings that moves you forward on the path. This five-part, 15-month program is followed five days a week, Monday through Friday. The study workbook encourages you to "Perform every task in ways that it advances you spiritually." </p>

<p>
When you order this supervised study, you will receive a set of PDF workbooks and worksheets. While learning the Master Course material, you will be guided to perform and track your achievements in these practices: 
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Doing each task well</li>
	<li>Observing the Pancha Nitya Karmas (virtuous living, worship, holy days, pilgrimage and sacraments)</li>
	<li>Taking opportunities to help others</li>
	<li>Developing 52 character qualities</li>
	<li>Performing Ganesha puja</li>
	<li>Attending temple puja in person or online</li>
	<li>Chanting Aum</li>
	<li>Utilizing affirmations</li>
	<li>Practicing hatha yoga</li>
	<li>Perfecting the preparation for meditation</li>
	<li>Living in the eternal now</li>
	<li>Worshiping Lord Ganesha during six common situations</li>
	<li>Performing exercises that claim your spiritual identity</li>
</ul>

<p>
You will also answer multiple-choice quizzes on the basics of Hindu philosophy and metaphysics. As you complete each worksheet, you will email it to Himalayan Academy.
</p>

<p>
The readings and some of these practices will take place during a daily vigil period&mdash;time set aside for your spiritual disciplines. Starting in Part Two, you will be asked to observe a half-hour vigil. Starting in Part Four, the vigil is one hour long. 
</p>

<p>
The Master Course textbooks<i>&mdash;Dancing with Siva, Living with Siva</i> and <i>Merging with Siva&mdash;</i>can be read in print, online or in any of the available ebook formats on a computer or mobile device of your choosing, such as an iPad or Kindle.
</p>

<p>
This formal study program is open to those of any religion or spiritual background. Students are not required to make any commitments other than to themselves to do the daily readings, follow the specific practices to the best of their ability, and fill in the worksheets. It is our public service to help anyone who wants to learn about Saivite Hinduism and strengthen their spiritual life. <a class="action" href="testimony">Read inspiring testimonies from students</a>

Those who wish to become a shishya (formal disciple) of Satguru Bodhinatha Veylanswami in his Saiva Siddhanta Church continue their learning about our Church and commit to serious steps, including formally converting to Saivite Hinduism and changing their names to Saivite Hindu names, taking a vegetarian vow and tithing on their income. <a class="action" href="/livespiritually/global-fellowship">Read more about the church</a>

<h3>2. Independent Study</h3>

<p>
You can also read the three books without following the Guided Study worksheets. Begin your daily reading with <i>Dancing with Siva,</i> shloka one and its bhashya. Then open <i>Living with Siva</i> and read Lesson One. Next, turn to the Nandinatha Sutras in Part Four of <i>Living with Siva</i> and read the first sutra. Finally, open <i>Merging with Siva</i> and read the first lesson. Reading each day's lesson from the three books of the trilogy takes about twenty minutes. Because there are only 155 lessons (shlokas and bhashyas) in <i>Dancing with Siva,</i> when you complete lesson 155 of this book, begin again at the beginning. Then, when you complete the second reading, totaling 310 days, begin again with lesson one, and continue reading until lesson 55, to coincide with lesson 365 of <i>Living with Siva</i> and <i>Merging with Siva.</i> If you study these lessons each day for a year, you will have completed a profound sadhana, a personal odyssey into the interior of you and on into the depths of Hinduism, a practice sufficient to transform your life by transforming the way you look at life itself. The Master Course trilogy of <i>Dancing, Living</i> and <i>Merging with Siva</i> can be enjoyed by the entire family year after year after year, studied personally and read aloud at breakfast, dinner or in the shrine room after the morning puja. Proceed with confidence and without delay.

<h3>3. Independent Digital Study</h3>

<p>
The Internet course begins anew on the first day of the Hindu year, April 13. But feel free to jump in and get started at any time. You need not wait for day one of the calendar year to roll around. Start with the current lesson, which might be number 132, and consider your year complete when you reach Lesson 131. You will find the lessons filled with philosophical, practical and soul-stirring information potent enough to inspire even a skeptic to change his ways of thinking about life and the ultimate goal of existence on this planet. Begin now. Today is the most auspicious time.
