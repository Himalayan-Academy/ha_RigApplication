<h4>Sloka 137 from <i>Dancing with Siva</i></h4>
<h3>
How Is Namah Sivaya Properly Chanted?</h3>
<p>
The Panchakshara Mantra, Namah Sivaya, is repeated verbally or mentally, often while counting a mala of rudraksha beads, drawing the mind in upon itself to cognize Lord Siva's infinite, all-pervasive presence. Aum.</p>
<h4>Bhashya</h4>
<p>
Japa yoga is the first yoga to be performed toward the goal of jnana. In the temple perform japa. Under your favorite tree perform japa. Seated in a remote cave perform japa. Aum Namah Sivaya can be performed on rudraksha beads over and over when the sun is setting, when the sun is rising or high noon lights the day. "Aum Namah Sivaya," the Saivite chants. Aum Namah Sivaya feeds his soul, brightens his intellect and quells his instinctive mind. Take the holy tears of Siva, the auburn rudraksha beads, into your hands. Push a bead over the middle finger with your thumb and hold as the intonation marks its passage. The duly initiated audibly repeats "Namah Sivaya," and when japa is performed silently, mentally chants "Sivaya Namah." There are many ways to chant this mantra, but perform it as you were initiated. Unauthorized experimentation is forbidden. Those prone to angry rage should never do japa. The Tirumantiram announces, "His feet are the letter Na. His navel is the letter Ma. His shoulders are the letter Shi. His mouth, the letter Va. His radiant cranial center aloft is Ya. Thus is the five-lettered form of Siva." Aum Namah Sivaya. </p>

<h4>Lesson 292 from <i>Living with Siva</i></h4>
<h3>
Consideration For Others </h3>
<p><BR>Consideration deals with the knowing principle. The opposite of consideration deals with the thinking principle. "I know what he means, and I know it is the best thing for me, but I don't think that it is right for me to do right now." That is how the thinking principle conflicts with the knowing principle within us. What does that create? It creates the individual, egotistical personality. <BR><BR>Consideration is a great principle to understand, and even a greater principle to unfold within yourself. If you can't be considerate of someone else's feelings, your soul is as if locked up in a little cage; and it can't get out, although it may be crying to express itself and hitting against that wall of the thinking mind which knows nothing at all about the qualities of the soul. <BR><BR>Knowing is the manifestation of your spiritual will. Consideration is also a manifestation of your spiritual will. When your spiritual will is awake, you have consideration for other people's feelings. When your spiritual will is awake, you give in on little things, and you have the power to hold firm on big issues, like keeping the twenty restraints and observances of the ancient Sanatana Dharma. You have an inner culture awakened within you. <BR><BR>Have you ever asked somebody to do some little thing, and he says "no"? He refuses to do it because he didn't think of it first, because he considers within himself that if he did do it, he would be falling under your domination? Why does he feel that way? It is because he has very little control over himself and is caught up in the thinking mind. But if you ask another type of individual to do something, it is done almost the minute you ask, he is so in tune with you. He has consideration for your feelings. He has consideration to the point where he doesn't want to upset the vibration around himself or around you by creating a situation. <BR><BR>By using the power of the thinking principle alone, we create situations for ourselves to face at another time, because each situation is of the subconscious mind and will manifest itself in life at a later date. Consideration is born of knowing, and knowing is a manifestation of your spiritual will, and your will shines forth when your soul begins to unfold itself. So, in order to be considerate, you have to exercise this knowing principle until it becomes manifest in your life every minute of every day. This is how to cultivate consideration. <BR><BR>How do we exercise our power to know? We have to look at people and ask ourself, "What do I know about my friends? What do I know about the depth of them? How deep are they?" We ponder, "What do I know about what I am reading--not just what I think about what I read? What do I really know about anything that I pick up and hold in my hand?" The knowing principle is very, very great. We study our mind: "If my intuition is working, do I know it is my intuition? If my subconscious mind is influencing my actions, do I know that I am attached to that state of mind?" What do you know? What do you not know? That is very important to know. <BR><BR>Going against what we know is a great pitfall. It is born from lack of consideration, lack of the ability to live in harmony with others, to fit into situations. Lacking consideration, we fail to fulfill the basic law of spiritual unfoldment: "Never miss an opportunity to serve." When we deliberately go against what we know, we create a burden that we don't want in our life, and we suffer under it. Then we ask, "Why do I feel so uninspired? I was doing so fine. I was so spiritual. I was feeling just wonderful. I felt all the life forces flowing through me, and all of a sudden it all stopped. Why did this have to happen to me? I thought I was doing fine. I was feeling so good." That's what I call a negative slump. <BR><BR></p>

<h4>Sutra 292 of the <i>Nandinatha Sutras</i></h4>
<h3>
Authorization To Perform Worship Rites </h3>
<p>
My initiated devotees perform the Saiva atmartha puja, but only in home shrines, not in temples. Unless formally, traditionally authorized, they are prohibited to learn, teach or perform the parartha temple puja. Aum.

<h4>Lesson 292 from <i>Merging with Siva</i></h4>
<h3>
Seven Centers of Instinctiveness</h3>
<p><BR>The seven chakras, or talas, below the spine down to the feet are all seats of instinctive consciousness, the origin of fear, anger, jealousy, confusion, selfishness, absence of conscience and malice. <BR><BR>The first chakra below the muladhara, called atala and located in the hips, governs the state of mind called fear. When someone is in this consciousness, he fears God as well as other people--even himself at times. In the chakra below that, called vitala and located in the thighs, anger predominates. Anger comes from despair or the threatening of oneself-will. When people are in the consciousness of this chakra, they are even angry at God. With their wrath, they often strike out at those around them, leaving a trail of hurt feelings behind them. From sustained anger arises a persistent, even burning, sense of resentment. <BR><BR>The third chakra below the muladhara, called sutala and located in the knees, governs jealousy. Jealousy is actually a feeling of inadequacy, inferiority and helplessness. When mixed with anger it causes terrible reactions within the nerve system of the astral body. When people are in the consciousness of this chakra, they often deny the existence of God and are contentiously combative with one another. <BR><BR>The fourth chakra below the muladhara, called talatala and located in the calves, governs instinctive willfulness, the desire to get rather than give, to push others no matter what the reactions may be, all to benefit oneself. When people are in the consciousness of this chakra they proclaim the existence of materialistic advancement over everything else. Greed, deceit, coercion, bribery and lust prevail. This is truly a "dog-eat-dog" state of mind. <BR><BR>The fifth chakra below the muladhara, called rasatala and located in the ankles, is the true home of the instinctive mind. When people are in the consciousness of this chakra they see to the well-being of "number one" first, "me, myself and I." Memory, reason, willfulness; thoughts, feelings and actions without conscience are all motivating factors here, governed by anger and fear. To this state of mind, jealousy, anger and fear are experienced as intense, even high, states of consciousness. There are even philosophies that have been conceived based on the states of consciousness experienced in these five chakras below the muladhara. One of these is existentialism. Many true atheists reside in the fifth chakra below the muladhara, and it is in this chakra that a great part of the mass consciousness resides at this time in the Kali Yuga. <BR><BR>There are still two more chakras below this one. The sixth chakra below the muladhara, called mahatala and located in the feet, is "theft without conscience." Persons living here feel that "the world owes them a living." They simply take what they justify to be theirs anyway. The seventh chakra below the muladhara, called patala and located in the soles of the feet, governs revenge, murder for the sake of murder, malice expressed through the destruction of others' goods, properties, minds, emotions and physical bodies. Hatred abides here. Malice reigns supreme. This is the consciousness of terrorists and those who support terrorists with vigor and enjoy from afar their every killing, rape and torturous act. Reason seldom influences those who live in this state of mind. <BR><BR>From here, at the bottom, there is no other way to go. The only way is up. Evolution takes its toll in bringing the consciousness of these wanton souls up and up into personal ego and some semblance of self-esteem, and then up into the ability of being jealous, then up into conquest of their fears and memory of their past actions, fearful that these horrific events might be repeated, then finally ascending into memory and reason, then into willpower in the manipura chakra. Here they may become religious, repentant, resistant to ever, ever wanting again to face the experiences they look back at constantly and cry about in their remorse. Yes, there is only one path. It goes up or it goes down. <BR><BR>Here, in the manipura chakra, which coordinates with the chakra of memory, they are ready to practice prayashchitta, penance, whatever it takes to extract the emotion from the memories which are tangled together deep in the subconscious. This is a painful process. But evolution makes it necessary to be lived through. Once accomplished--and practically speaking it is not easily or always accomplished--this changes for the better the course of the pranas that flow through the subconscious, the sub of the subconscious and subsuperconscious mind for themselves, their family, ancestors and progeny several generations back and many generations into the future. <BR><BR>To further explain, those who are well settled in consciousness within these seven chakras below the muladhara are not interested in religion. They are irreverent and deny the existence of God. It is here that superstitious fears often prevail. There are no rules. There is no conscience. The various interrelated states of consciousness found within these seven chakras foster chaos, confusion, feelings of hopelessness, despair--all adharmic states of mind. These are the rates of vibration of the instinctive mind below the muladhara, where Lord Ganesha sits in all His majesty.<BR><BR></p>
