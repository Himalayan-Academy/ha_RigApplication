<h4>Sloka 153 from <i>Dancing with Siva</i></h4>
<h3>
Who Were the Early Kailasa Preceptors?</h3>
<p>
Among its ancient gurus, the Kailasa Parampara honors the illustrious Rishi Tirumular and his generations of successors. In recent history we especially revere the silent siddha called "Rishi from the Himalayas." Aum.</p>
<h4>Bhashya</h4>
<p>
Having achieved perfect enlightenment and the eight siddhis at the feet of Maharishi Nandinatha in the Himalayas, Rishi Tirumular was sent by his satguru to revive Saiva Siddhanta in the South of India. Finally, he reached Tiruvavaduthurai, where, in the Tamil language, he recorded the truths of the Saiva Agamas and the precious Vedas in the Tirumantiram, a book of over 3,000 esoteric verses. Through the centuries, the Kailasa mantle was passed from one siddha yogi to the next. Among these luminaries was the nameless Rishi from the Himalayas, who in the 1700s entered a teashop in a village near Bangalore, sat down and entered into deep samadhi. He did not move for seven years, nor did he speak. Streams of devotees came for his darshana. Their unspoken prayers and questions were mysteriously answered in dreams or in written, paper messages that manifested in the air and floated down. Then one day Rishi left the village, later to pass his power to Kadaitswami. The Tirumantiram expounds, "With Nandi's grace I sought the primal cause. With Nandi's grace I Sadasiva became. With Nandi's grace truth divine I attained." Aum Namah Sivaya.</p>

<h4>Lesson 308 from <i>Living with Siva</i></h4>
<h3>
Freedom and Responsibility </h3>
<p><BR>A human being has a dual and nondual component. He has belief. He has faith. He has love. But all of these fine qualities can be taken away through discouragement. His faith is faith in the unseen. His belief is belief in things that are not always intellectually rational. His love is love of all that is tender and beautiful. All of these fine qualities and many more work together in lifting up consciousness toward the ultimate reality of timelessness, causelessness and spacelessness. There is not one human being on the planet who will not eventually understand the monistic theist approach. This is because it is an intrinsic part of the human psyche. Everyone is a monistic theist in one way or another. <BR><BR>Historically, there have always been monists on one side and theists on the other. The one path that is made up of these two camps is monistic theism. It encompasses both. And, yes, it is the solution to many of the problems people face today. Saiva Siddhanta is the final conclusion of the adepts, and it includes the true precepts of Vedanta. There can only be one final conclusion, and that is monistic theism. <BR><BR>The problem is that Vedanta as taught today gives privilege without the disciplines, creating jnanis of intellect rather than realization. This privilege is taken as a boon by those of little spiritual attainment. Freedom without responsibility is another privilege given. This is also taken advantage of by the undisciplined; whereas discipline and responsibility should be taught and mastered before higher philosophy is delved into and practiced with any seriousness. The beginner should not be taught to rationalize on the nature of man and the universe from what he has memorized. He should be brought into the culture and community of Hinduism and establish a religious, fully committed, disciplined life before proceeding onward. We must become aware that the neo-Indian approach to Vedanta is very new, indeed. The true Vedantists--those who have reached the ultimate realizations--have reached them by following the path of monistic theism. Modern Vedanta gives privilege without discipline, and the modern New Age movement gives freedom without responsibility. Is there a difference? <BR><BR>Monistic theism does not give privilege. It preaches a more pragmatic approach to life. Saiva Siddhanta builds character within the individual--spiritually, socially, culturally, economically, karmically and dharmically. Aspirants have to meet a series of daily, monthly, yearly fulfillments. Truly, monistic theism is the path to mukti and merger. <BR><BR>The monistic Saiva Siddhanta bhaktar can understand and appreciate the point of view of anyone, because his love of Sivaness in all extends his communication faculties. He is able to talk with each philosopher on his own level. When this happens, the feeling of sharing and giving exists. The bhaktar is wise enough to know that the other person may not understand his point of view. This ability is a great barometer for judging the attainment of any bhaktar, whether he can or cannot actually be one with--in empathy with, in heart and mind, in love and trust--rich man, poor man, beggar man, thief, doctor, lawyer, temple priest and in his heart make no differences. This is the true Siva bhaktar; this is the true monistic theist; this is the true Saiva Siddhantin; this is the true Advaita Ishvaravada adept, who lives the statement, "Lord Siva is the Life within the life of everyone," as a fact, not a metaphor. <BR><BR></p>

<h4>Sutra 308 of the <i>Nandinatha Sutras</i></h4>
<h3>
Remolding The Subconscious </h3>
<p>
My devotees succeed by remolding subconscious magnetic forces. They purge the dross through vasana daha tantra--writing and burning past transgressions and current problems--then use positive affirmations. Aum.

<h4>Lesson 308 from <i>Merging with Siva</i></h4>
<h3>
The Devotee's Responsibilities</h3>
<p><BR>The aspirant may go to his guru and be one with him by preparing himself to receive his grace. As a result he may be able to meditate, to keep his personal karma subdued sufficiently to quiet the inner forces. Once a guru has been chosen, the aspirant must be loyal to him and stay with that one guru only. He should not go from one to another, because of these subtle, powerful inner, connecting vibrations of darshan and the training received through the power of a satguru's use of darshan. These inner, mystical laws protect the guru himself against people who wander from one guru to another, as well as warn the seeker against the fluctuating forces of his own mind as he creates and breaks the subtle yet powerful relationship with a holy person. <BR><BR>Satguru darshan opens psychic seals in the devotee by moving his awareness out of an area that he does not want to be in. Similarly, a blowtorch changes the consistency of metal. The satguru is like the sun. He is just there, radiating this very pure energy like the sun evaporates water. The satguru hardly does anything at all. It is the seeker who opens himself to the great accumulated power of darshan which the guru inherited from his guru and his guru's guru, as well as the natural darshan he unfolded from within himself through his evolution and practices of sadhana and tapas. It's all up to the aspirant at first. <BR><BR>A satguru doesn't do a thing. The guru can amuse himself externally with anything. It does not make any difference in his darshan when he is at a certain point in his unfoldment. If you are around him long enough, and if you are honest with yourself and persistent in the tasks he asks you to perform and directions he gives you, psychic seals lift after awhile. But you have to do your part. He does his in an inner way, and as he does, you will feel the psychic seals melt away under his fiery darshan, just like a blowtorch penetrates and transforms the metal it touches.<BR><BR></p>
