<p>For those seeking a deeper understanding of our spiritual path, Himalayan Academy provides two primary programs: The Master Course and Innersearch Travel-Study. Our founder, Satguru Sivaya Subramunyaswami, spent a lifetime developing his Master Course trilogy of books which explore the metaphysical, religious and cultural foundations on which Kauai's Hindu Monastery is built. He knew that spiritual life must include not only our meditative disciplines and experiences, but also our day-to-day lifestyle, relationships, thoughts and actions. Thus his Master Course explores every dimension of life, all grounded in Hindu tradition. Those seeking to draw near their innermost divine identity and those seeking to qualify for deeper initiations and membership in Saiva Siddhanta Church all complete this study under the guidance of Gurudeva's successor, Satguru Bodhinatha Veylanswami. This is the intellectual, religious and cultural bedrock of our fellowship.

<h3 class="h3">The Master Course</h3>
            
<p>At the core of The Master Course is Gurudeva's all-encompassing 3,000-page trilogy<i>&mdash;Dancing with Siva, Living with Siva</i> and <i>Merging with Siva&mdash;</i>exploring all aspects of life from the perspective of Saivite Hinduism. For casual students, study involves reading the daily lesson from these three books each day. <a href="http://www.feedblitz.com/f/?Sub=&amp;Publisher=7522423&amp;portal=331383">Click here to sign up for daily lessons by email.</a> This can be accomplished with the books in their printed or electronic forms or by signing up for our 365 Daily Lessons email.
