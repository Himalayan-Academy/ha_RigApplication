					<br />The genius behind the Spiritual Park was<a href="/monastery/lineage-philosophy/gurudeva"> Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami (1927-2001)</a>, beloved Gurudeva to thousands of devotees, a spiritual giant who knew no challenge too great to meet, no obstacle too imposing to overcome, no hurt too deep to assuage, no detail too insignificant to address. He was called to Mauritius in 1981, by elders who sought his help in strengthening the religion of their forefathers and to engage the children. He spent months visiting all corners of the island, and immediately felt a love for Mauritians. He returned, again and again, finally deciding to establish a center here. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The Spiritual Park started with a vision. Gurudeva shared: "In 1986 I had a powerful vision of Lord Ganesha while I was here in Mauritius looking for property for Saiva Siddhanta Church. Lord Ganesha was walking from His temple attended by two priests. He was about to take a bath in the beautiful Indian Ocean in the country of Mauritius where the river meets the sea. I was standing in the water with several sharks swimming around me. Lord Ganesha, accompanied by two priests, looked at me and said, 'Just rub some oil on their noses and they will not harm you.' The vision led me directly to this special land by the Rempart River and its lagoon. The Spiritual Park is a fulfillment of that vision (illustrated below). I see it combining environmental and architectural beauty that will give spiritual peace and mystical knowledge to visitors for many generations in the future. It is destined to become a pilgrimage site of great renown in the Indian Ocean area. Hindus from Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Africa and India, will come here." 
				</p>
				<p>
					In that same year Gurudeva acquired this riverside property as a monastery and converted the chalet-style bungalow on the west side into a monastic residence, where his monks lived and served. A few years later, he dedicated six acres of his Saiva Dharmasala as a Spiritual Park. In 1999 he traveled to Mauritius to publicly inaugurate his Spiritual Park as a gift to the island nation. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Through his 50 years of ministry, Gurudeva inspired thousands of people of all walks of life to change their habits and routines, to become more deeply religious, to follow a path of sadhana for spiritual evolution and character-building. He placed great emphasis on devotion to the Hindu Gods, who, through holy places such as the Spiritual Park, can commune with humankind, send blessings, guide, uplift and protect. To him, the Gods were good friends; he saw them and communed with them. It was this perception of the reality of the inner worlds that he sought to solidify and glorify at his Spiritual Park by building a sanctified abode for Lord Ganesha. Whenever he visited Mauritius, Gurudeva would boldly speak of the need for all Hindus to work more closely together, which he called "Hindu solidarity." He spoke out his Saiva Siddhanta teachings on the island, seeking to uplift sincere devotees and give them the opportunity to deepen their commitment to Hinduism and to pass their ancient religion of love and peace on to the next generation. He was deeply interested in religious training for children.

					To Where The River Meets The Sea ...<br />For Worship, Meditation And Inspiration
				</h3>
				<p>
					Welcome to our tropical paradise on the north shore of Mauritius, the Pearl of the Indian Ocean. Hindu seekers are drawn here throughout the year seeking peace, insight, blessings and the rare opportunity for personal worship of the Divine in a natural setting. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The presiding Deity in the Spiritual Park is the eight-foot-tall granite Panchamukha Ganapati. This majestic five-faced, ten-armed Ganapati looks over azure blue seas facing India--a towering reminder of the original home of the nation's Hindus and of the importance of harmony in life. 
				</p>
				<p>
					To get to the Panchamukha Ganapati Mandapam we walk along a winding path on the west side of the park, crossing a wooden bridge and entering a grove of mango trees. Here we find an incredibly beautiful pavilion of spiritual and architectural uniqueness. It is a one-of-a-kind, wooden shrine built in the Kerala style with thatched roof, the first ever crafted outside of India. 
				</p>

				<p>
					Ganapati is not alone here in this heavenly sanctuary. In the mid-region of the park near the river stands an eight-foot-tall, black granite Dakshinamurti, the south-facing form of Lord Siva representing the silent guru. Wandering eastward on the riverside path through groves of flowering trees, we come across, on the far east of the property, an eight-foot-tall, six-faced black granite Muruga, known as Lord Karttikeya in the north of India. His dynamic power awakens spiritual cognition to propel souls onward in their evolution to Siva's feet. He stands here majestically, facing the lagoon and watching the sun rise each day over the vast Indian Ocean, protecting the fishermen and ships at sea. 
				</p>
				<p>
					On the far west of the property is the Mini Mela gift store. Here we can purchase Gurudeva's books and a variety of Indian bric-a-brac. Next to the Mini Mela is the main monastery building, which is closed to the public.

					Pilgrimage is a time for powerful, life-changing inner work. There are several sadhanas (spiritual practices) that can be performed at the Spiritual Park. The beautiful gardens and groves provide an ideal setting for deep meditation in nature. The Sadhu Sadhana is to wander in the outdoor sanctuary with no place to go, enjoying the colors and beauty of nature in silence, releasing all worries, quieting the mind and getting in touch with the inner you. The Master Course Sadhana consists of studying Gurudeva's main books in the Panchamukha Ganapati Mandapam.

				<p>
					During Ganesha Chaturthi each year, the celebrations are grand and elaborate, as shown in the photo to the left. Thousands of devotees attend to worship Ganesha and receive the blessings of Satguru Bodhinatha Veylanswami, who visits here each year at this time. During the five-day festival to Panchamukha Ganapati (December 21 to 25 each year), an exciting one-day program is organised for children. If you come on the first Sunday of any month, you will be able to participate in a sacred homa to Panchamukha Ganapati (starting at 10:30am), bhajana, brief meditation and cultural activities, followed by a veggie lunch. By prior arrangement, Hindu groups are welcome to use the sanctuary as an ideal setting for their own events and programs. And perhaps most importantly, there are weekly classes for children.
