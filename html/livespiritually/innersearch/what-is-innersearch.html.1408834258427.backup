<h1 class="h1">What is Innersearch?</h1>
								
	<p>Here is your opportunity to travel with a satguru and his monks on their periodic journeys for personalized instruction in The Master Course. Twenty-two Innersearch travel-study programs have been held since 1967, taking hundreds of seekers to India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Tahiti, Hawaii, Malaysia, Japan, Thailand, Russia, Switzerland, the Caribbean, Scandinavia, Australia, New Zealand and dozens of other regions. You can be sure that Innersearch is not your typical vacation but a travel experience that combines the mystical path of Indian spirituality with a superlative retreat from your day-to-day routine.</p>
	<p>
	Each voyage is a pilgrimage to the divine and spectacular inside of you. The all-pervading beauty, color and grandeur of the outer voyage is but a reflection of the bliss and richness of the inner voyage as we delve the within together. A typical day includes morning classes exploring the esoterics of meditation and discussing how to live a spiritually dynamic life in a modern world. There are hatha yoga and meditation classes, question-and-answer sessions, instruction in Shum, Gurudeva's language of meditation, and lots of time for informal sharing with Bodhinatha and the swamis. Some of the most enriching moments are when we meet with Hindu communities, often joining in grand celebrations as they welcome us to the temples they have erected around the world. </p>

<h3 class="h3">History of Innersearch</h3>

	
	<p>The 1967 Actinic's World Tour was Himalayan Acadamy's first-ever Innersearch. Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami, affectionately known as Gurudeva, lead a group of spiritual aspirants to Europe and North Africa, writing his Yoga Letters along the way and holding a Yoga Conference in Holland.</p>
