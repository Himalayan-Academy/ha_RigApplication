<p>Our program will begin on the evening of <b>July 2</b> with our traditional "Crow's Nest" orientation gathering, followed by dinner. On <b>July 3,</b> we will dive right in to three full days of classes on a variety of religious and spiritual subjects led by Satguru Bodhinatha Veylanswami and the swamis traveling with him on the program. Accommodations will be in Belle Mare, nearby our Spiritual Park, which is located at La Pointe des Lascars, Rivi&egrave;re du Rempart, in the northeast of the island, and we will drive a short distance by bus each day to the Spiritual Park for classes and other activities. <b>July 6</b> will see thousands of people from all over the island descend upon the Spiritual Park for our monthly Ganesha Homa, a grand ceremony centered on the beautiful Panchamukha Ganapati Mandapam, the centerpiece of the property. Then we will break for two days of outings, <b>July 7-8,</b> including one or two temples and some fun adventures to imbibe the beauty of this tropical island. On <b>July 9,</b> we dive back in to three more full days of classes with Bodhinatha and his swamis, rounding out our experience, asking questions and learning many tools we can use to apply our new knowledge in our daily lives back home. <b>July 12</b> is another special day, Satguru Purnima, the festival honoring gurus of all Hindu traditions and lineages. This year for the first time, Satguru Bodhinatha Veylanswami will be present at the Spiritual Park for the grand annual celebration held here in honor of him and the Nandinatha Sampradaya's Kailasa Parampara, the lineage of Saiva Siddhanta Church and Kauai's Hindu Monastery that began with Maharishi Nandinatha over 2,200 years ago and which was passed on to Bodhinatha in 2001 by his guru, Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami, who first visited Mauritius in the early 1980s. One more day of activities will follow, and the program will conclude with our traditional Aloha Breakfast on the morning of <b>July 14.</b></p>
