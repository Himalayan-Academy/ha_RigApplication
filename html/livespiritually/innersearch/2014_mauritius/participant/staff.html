<b>Paramacharya Sadasivanatha Palaniswami</b>, the head of the Ganapati Kulam, arranged the very first Innersearch program for Gurudeva in 1968 and has led the staff of all 22 programs since then. He is the inspiration behind the design of most of our teaching materials, including Bodhinatha's exotic Keynote presentations and the revolutionary, must-be-seen-to-be-believed study guide for this program. Sadasivanathaswami will teach six of the classes during the program.

He will also teach a few of the classes during the program.
