<h2 class="h2">What to Pack <b>(NEW)</b></h2>

<p>It's never too early to think about packing. Here is a short list of basic items that we suggest bringing with you to Mauritius. Those of us coming from the Northern Hemisphere must be reminded that July means winter in Mauritius. For the month, the average low is 16&deg;C (60&deg;F), and the average high is 22&deg;C (72&deg;F).
</p>

<p>
Keep in mind that this is just a preliminary list of suggestions for you to blend in to your usual personal packing list.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Flight itineraries, confirmation numbers and boarding passes</li>
	<li>Local ID and passport</li>
	<li>One or two light jackets, sweaters and/or warm shawls</li>

	<li>Proper attire for two formal dinner occasions (preferably Indian, but Western is okay, too)</li>
	<li>Small day bag for outings</li>
	<li>Modest swimsuit (no bikinis)</li>

<p>*Mauritius uses the same type of 240V power plug as the UK, Malaysia and Singapore, as shown in the image here. Any universal plug adapter will support this format. Be sure to examine the power specs on the devices you intend to plug in. Most, but not all, modern devices have power supplies that already support a voltage range of ~100-240V. If your device only supports 120V, you will need to use a heavy transformer adapter rather than a simple plug-only adapter. It's always best to check before plugging in to avoid destroying the device or its power supply.</p>

<p>
Please note that Hindu dress is encouraged for classes, meals, temple visits and other important occasions, but it is not required. Smart casual and formal Western attire, each for their respective occasions, are fine if you do not have traditional Indian clothes. Long pants or dresses and kurta or polo shirts are encouraged for excursions. Please, no shorts, short-dresses or tank tops.

<p>
We encourage everybody to travel light. You will be required to carry your own luggageâ€”for example on and off the bus into the hotel. A good test after you have packed is to carry your bags (including all daypacks, jackets and camera cases!) for 100 meters. If you have any difficulty, we would recommend a re-pack and exploring luggage with wheels! You should not expect other group members to assist with your baggage.
