<h2 class="h2">Accommodations and Ground Transportation</h2>

<p>We will be staying at the <a href="http://www.jalsabeach.com/">Jalsa Beach Hotel &amp; Spa</a> in the town of <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Jalsa+Beach+Hotel+%26+Spa/@-20.14107,57.74888,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x217cfc3095555545:0xfb4222578c4936f7">Poste Lafayette</a>, just a 15-20 minute ride from our <a href="https://www.himalayanacademy.com/blog/taka/category/mauritius-spiritual-park/">Spiritual Park</a>, which is located at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Pointe+des+Lascars+Hindu+Spiritual+Park/@-20.090709,57.705417,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xd1b9751931b8e0ce">Pointe des Lascars</a>, where la Rivi√®re du Rampart meets the sea.</p>

<p>The group booking covered by your program fees includes 12 nights, checking in on July 2 and checking out on July 14, 2014.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Extra Nights</h3>

<p>For those arriving a night or more before the program and/or staying a night or more afterward, the Jalsa Beach Hotel has offered a very special price of US$110/night double-occupancy or $86/night single-occupancy on half-board basis (including breakfast and dinner). You will need to provide a credit card upon check-in; all nights that do not fall within the official Innersearch program (as well as any extras during the program, such as laundry, drinks at the bar, any meals not ordered by the program coordinator) will be payable directly to the hotel by you upon check-out. If you are coming alone and not staying single-occupancy, a roommate will be assigned to you for the duration of the program. If your roommate is not staying the same extra nights that you are, you will be charged the single-occupancy rate for said nights. Those with roommates staying together on extra nights may split the double-occupancy charge for extra nights, of course. The Innersearch staff is making the appropriate arrangements for extra nights on your behalf based on the flight arrival and departure information you have submitted.</p>

<p>
For participants arriving well before the 2:00pm check-in time, the hotel has pledged to do their best to allocate rooms for early check-in. For those whose flights leave at night, the hotel can accommodate late check-out for a nominal fee of Rs 1,000 (US$33) per room, depending upon availability, which can only be confirmed two days prior to departure.

<h3 class="h3">Ground Transportation <b>(NEW)</b></h3>

Upon arrival, following immigration, baggage claim and customs, please proceed to Exit 7, counter no. 25, where a representative named Amar from Seaside Holidays will greet you and show you to the vehicle for your transfer to Jalsa Beach Hotel. A signboard reading "Innersearch 2014" will be present at the counter for clarity. </p>

Transportation from and to the hotel, the Spiritual Park and other destinations in Mauritius for all Innersearch activities will be provided by motor coach. You will not need to hire a car during the program. </p>
