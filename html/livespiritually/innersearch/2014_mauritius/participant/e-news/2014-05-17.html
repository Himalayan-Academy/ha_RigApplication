<p>
Namaskaram, Innersearchers!
</p>

<p>
As we near the six-week mark in advance of our program, we would like to introduce you to the first of several sadhanas that we recommend completing before your pilgrimage begins. These preparations will not only move you into a more spiritual state of mind, they will also add weight to the journey you are preparing for, creating a strong impression in your subconscious mind of how personally important these days of ours together will be. As you are spread around the globe, these simple sadhanas, being observed by each one, will create a shared experience, bringing you inwardly closer to each other even before we meet in Mauritius.

<h3>
Pilgrimage Preparation Sadhana #1: Vasana Daha Tantra
</h3>

<p>
Perform the vasana daha tantra covering the last five years of your life, starting with the most recent year and working backward in time, ten pages per year. For those unfamiliar with this practice, it is the process of hand-writing and burning the emotionally charged experiences from you subconscious—be they negatively or positively charged. Details for this can be found by clicking <a href="http://www.himalayanacademy.com/book/living-with-siva/91">here</a>, which will take you to Chapter 18, "The Power of Penance," in Gurudeva's <i>Living with Siva</i> for a full explanation of this practice.

Mark Twain's Travel Diary on Mauritius
</h3>

<p>
It occurred to us that you would enjoy an excerpt from Mark Twain's travel diary Following the Equator, in which he makes his way from India to Mauritius in April of 1895, describing (somewhat humorously) its simple beauty:
</p>

<p style="padding:0 35px 0 35px;">
Wednesday, April 15. Mauritius. Arrived and anchored off Port Louis. Rugged clusters of crags and peaks, green to their summits; from their bases to the sea a green plain with just tilt enough to it to make the water drain off. I believe it is in 56 E and 22 S—a hot tropical country. The green plain has an inviting look; has scattering dwellings nestling among the greenery. 
</p>

<p style="padding:0 35px 0 35px;">
Thursday, April 16. Went ashore in the forenoon at Port Louis, a little town, but with the largest variety of nationalities and complexions we have encountered yet. French, English, Chinese, Arabs, Africans with wool, blacks with straight hair, East Indians, half-whites, quadroons—and great varieties in costumes and colors.
</p>

<p style="padding:0 35px 0 35px;">
Took the train for Curepipe at 1.30—two hours' run, gradually uphill. What a contrast, this frantic luxuriance of vegetation, with the arid plains of India; these architecturally picturesque crags and knobs and miniature mountains, with the monotony of the Indian dead-levels.
</p>

<p style="padding:0 35px 0 35px;">
A native pointed out a handsome swarthy man of grave and dignified bearing, and said in an awed tone, "That is so-and-so; has held office of one sort or another under this government for 37 years—he is known all over this whole island and in the other countries of the world perhaps—who knows? One thing is certain; you can speak his name anywhere in this whole island, and you will find not one grown person that has not heard it. It is a wonderful thing to be so celebrated; yet look at him; it makes no change in him; he does not even seem to know it."
</p>

<p style="padding:0 35px 0 35px;">
Curepipe (means Pincushion or Pegtown, probably). Sixteen miles (two hours) by rail from Port Louis. At each end of every roof and on the apex of every dormer window a wooden peg two feet high stands up; in some cases its top is blunt, in others the peg is sharp and looks like a toothpick. The passion for this humble ornament is universal.
</p>

<p style="padding:0 35px 0 35px;">
Apparently, there has been only one prominent event in the history of Mauritius, and that one didn't happen. I refer to the romantic sojourn of Paul and Virginia here. It was that story that made Mauritius known to the world, made the name familiar to everybody, the geographical position of it to nobody.
</p>

<p style="padding:0 35px 0 35px;">
April 18. This is the only country in the world where the stranger is not asked "How do you like this place?" This is indeed a large distinction. Here the citizen does the talking about the country himself; the stranger is not asked to help. You get all sorts of information. From one citizen you gather the idea that Mauritius was made first, and then heaven; and that heaven was copied after Mauritius. Another one tells you that this is an exaggeration; that the two chief villages, Port Louis and Curepipe, fall short of heavenly perfection; that nobody lives in Port Louis except upon compulsion, and that Curepipe is the wettest and rainiest place in the world.
</p>

<p style="padding:0 35px 0 35px;">
What there is of Mauritius is beautiful. You have undulating wide expanses of sugar-cane—a fine, fresh green and very pleasant to the eye; and everywhere else you have a ragged luxuriance of tropic vegetation of vivid greens of varying shades, a wild tangle of underbrush, with graceful tall palms lifting their crippled plumes high above it; and you have stretches of shady dense forest with limpid streams frolicking through them, continually glimpsed and lost and glimpsed again in the pleasantest hide-and-seek fashion; and you have some tiny mountains, some quaint and picturesque groups of toy peaks, and a dainty little vest-pocket Matterhorn; and here and there and now and then a strip of sea with a white ruffle of surf breaks into the view.
</p>

<p style="padding:0 35px 0 35px;">
That is Mauritius; and pretty enough. The details are few, the massed result is charming, but not imposing; not riotous, not exciting; it is a Sunday landscape. Perspective, and the enchantments wrought by distance, are wanting. There are no distances; there is no perspective, so to speak. Fifteen miles as the crow flies is the usual limit of vision. Mauritius is a garden and a park combined. It affects one's emotions as parks and gardens affect them. The surfaces of one's spiritual deeps are pleasantly played upon, the deeps themselves are not reached, not stirred. Spaciousness, remote altitudes, the sense of mystery which haunts apparently inaccessible mountain domes and summits reposing in the sky—these are the things which exalt the spirit and move it to see visions and dream dreams.
</p>

<p style="padding:0 35px 0 35px;">
It is no proper rest for the mind to clatter from town to town in the dust and cinders, and examine galleries and architecture, and be always meeting people and lunching and teaing and dining, and receiving worrying cables and letters. And a sea voyage on the Atlantic is of no use—voyage too short, sea too rough. The peaceful Indian and Pacific Oceans and the long stretches of time are the healing thing.
