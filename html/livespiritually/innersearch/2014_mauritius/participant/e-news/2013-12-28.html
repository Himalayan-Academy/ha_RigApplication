<h2 class="h2">E-news Update for December 28, 2013</h2>

<p>
Namaskaram, Innersearchers!
</p>

<p>
Another few months have flown us by, and we're that much closer to our magnificent journey together. Our team here at the monastery has been diving in to the many details of our program. While coordinating with Saiva Siddhanta Church members on the ground in Mauritius, we are getting an in-depth look at the experiences we'll be having on their beautiful island. Our Mauritian kulapatis have graciously and joyously volunteered to be our eyes, ears, hands and feet, for the program. They each possess an array of local knowledge which will ensure us a smooth and memorable stay as they coordinate teams of members to help plan and execute various parts of our inner and outer adventures. Currently, our daily schedules are being worked out in detail, from the time we wake up and have breakfast together, to the time we savor our socialite dinner after having had an unforgettable day of spiritual activities and island explorations. Spaces for holding classes at the Spiritual Park are being looked at, outing possibilities are being researched, hotel details are being refined and meal plans are beginning to be developed. All the pieces are falling in place.

<p>
We currently have 28 out of 50 possible participants signed up, and we will be supplementing our outreach efforts in the next couple of months. If you know of anyone who would benefit from attending the program and who might be inspired by a personal invitation, please consider speaking with them or sending us their contact information.

We recently happened across this archival video of an interview with Gurudeva while in Mauritius, and we thought it would be wonderful to share it with all of you. See the recently posted interview <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ag3Xx9qLQcQ">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
Please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out with any questions you may have in the months ahead. We will continue to keep you informed as the program develops and as we have more logistical information that you will need.
</p>

<p>
All of the Innersearch staff extend our best wishes to you for a prosperous 2014.
