<h1 class="h1">Innersearch Mauritius 2014</h1>

<h2 class="h2">E-news Update for April 19, 2014</h2>

<p>
Aloha, Innersearchers!
</p>

<p>
The full fifty participants, our limit, has been reached, and with the staff there will be 57 of us in Mauritius together. Paramacharya Sadasivanathaswami has read all of your applications and observes, "Remember, each of you is unique, just like everybody else." We have gathered a wonderful group of seeking souls from 10 countries, and you are all going to enjoy getting to know one another during our voyage together.
</p>

<p>
Our coordination team here at the monastery and our volunteers in Mauritius have been making great strides in the last few weeks, mapping out the fine details of the program. We have a solid and balanced schedule, and our study guide is in the process of creation. Transportation during the program is being finalized, several wonderful outings are on the drawing board, and last but not least, pujas at the Spiritual Park and at one of the island’s beautiful temples are being prepared for.

<p>
A great amount of class content has been assembled by Satguru Bodhinatha Veylanswami and his sannyasins. We are all in for a wonderful 12 days, not just learning about a spiritual life, but living one. Traveling with a satguru and his monks is a special experience. As Gurudeva often pointed out, we all-to-often begin to take on the qualities of those we frequently associate with. And isn’t it true that the people that are most secure in themselves are often the ones we end up emulating? 
</p>

<p>
During this journey you’ll get many chances to mingle with those whose life mission is to find their strength within, to deepen their spiritual progress. We hope that the vibration created by Bodhinatha and his monks will inspire you to intensify your practice and to live it more than you read about it or talk about it. All the wisdom you will hear, read, see and feel on this journey is but a signpost pointing the way inward, toward your own blissful inner being.

"We only see opposites when our vision is limited, when we have not experienced totally. There is a point of view which resolves all contradictions and answers all questions. Yet to be experienced is yet to be understood. Once experienced and understood, the Quiet comes. The karmas are quiet. This is the arduous path of chary  kriya and yoga resulting in jnana. This is the path of not only endeavoring to unfold the higher nature, but, at the same time and toward the same end, dealing positively and consciously with the remnants of the lower nature. Following this spiritual path, we find ourselves effortlessly replacing charity for greed and dealing with, rather than merely suppressing, the instinctive feelings of jealousy, hatred, desire and anger."  <i>Gurudeva</i>

<h3>
Extra Nights at Jalsa Beach Hotel
</h3>

<p>
For those arriving a night or more before the program and/or staying a night or more afterward, the Jalsa Beach Hotel has offered a very special price of US$110/night double-occupancy or $86/night single-occupancy on half-board basis (including two meals per day). You will need to provide a credit card upon check-in; all nights that do not fall within the official Innersearch program will be payable directly to the hotel by you upon check-out. If you are coming alone and not staying single-occupancy, a roommate will be assigned to you for the duration of the program. If your roommate is not staying the same extra nights that you are, you will be charged the single-occupancy rate for said nights. Those with roommates staying staying together on extra nights may split the double-occupancy charge for extra nights, of course. The Innersearch staff is making the appropriate arrangements for extra nights on your behalf. Your flight details (including arrival and departure dates, times, airlines and flight numbers) have proven invaluable toward this end. If you have not yet sent your flight details to us, please do so as soon as possible.
