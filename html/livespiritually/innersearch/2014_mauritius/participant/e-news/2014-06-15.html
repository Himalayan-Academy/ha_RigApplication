<h3>
Your Next Innersearch Preparation Sadhana
</h3>

<p>
Today we suggest that you begin the daily practice of japa, repeating the mantra "Aum" 108 times. If you already practice japa using a different mantra, please continue with that mantra instead.
</p>

<p style="padding:0 35px 0 35px;">Aum is the universal mantra which can be performed safely by the initiated and the uninitiated alike, can be chanted by those of all religions, without restriction, under any condition, in any circumstance, whether the body is clean or dirty. It will heighten consciousness by harmonizing the physical with the mental and spiritual when chanted correctly. 
</p>

<p style="padding:0 35px 0 35px;">For Aum japa to be effective, the mantra must be pronounced correctly. The first syllable is A, pronounced as the English word "awe," but prolonged: "aaa." The second syllable is U, as in "roof," pronounced "oo" but prolonged: "ooo." The third syllable is M, pronounced "mm" with the front teeth gently touching and the sound prolonged: "mmmm."
</p>

<p style="padding:0 35px 0 35px;">Each repetition is sounded for about seven seconds, with two seconds on A, two seconds on U and three seconds on M, with a silence of about two seconds before the next repetition. The three syllables are run together: AAUUMM (silence), AAUUMM (silence), AAUUMM (silence). 
</p>

<p style="padding:0 35px 0 35px;">On the first syllable, A, we feel the solar plexus vibrating. On the second syllable, U, the throat vibrates. The third syllable, M, vibrates the top of the head. Thus, proper chanting of Aum also is a high form of yoga, moving energy from the lower chakras of the body up to the highest chakra, or energy centerâ€”the sahasrara chakra at the crown of the head.
</p>

<p style="padding:0 35px 0 35px;">Gurudeva explained, "All tones together make the Aum. Listen to the ocean and you hear the Aum. Listen to all the noises of a city blended together and you hear the Aum. Listen to all the tones of the physical body and you hear the Aum."
</p>

<p>
Supplementary Reading from Merging with Siva, Lesson 262: 
</p>

<p style="padding:0 35px 0 35px;">When we chant the mantra Aum, and do it correctly, we pronounce the AA so that it vibrates the physical body. The OO has to vibrate through the throat area, and the MM, the head. In doing this, we are deliberately moving awareness out of the muladhara and svadhishthana chakras, deliberately harmonizing all the forces of the instinct and physical body, and of the ida and the pingala currents. Chanting the AA and the OO and the MM brings the sushumna into power. We are transmuting and changing the flows of all the energies through the physical and astral body and blending them as much as possible into the body of the soul.
</p>

<p style="padding:0 35px 0 35px;">The mantra Aum can be chanted at any time. It can be chanted silently and cause the same vibration through the body. When you chant Aum, the ida and the pingala blend back into the sushumna.
