<h2 class="h2">E-news Update for October 1, 2013</h2>

<p>
Jai Ganesha, who guides us always along the right path and will be awaiting our arrival at the Spiritual Park in Mauritius!
</p>

<p>
Namaste Innersearchers:
</p>

<p>
Though we are nine months from departure, already there is a sense of adventure in the air and the sure knowledge that our departure dates will arrive much sooner than we think.
</p>

<p>
During our days on the enchanting island of Mauritius, much of our time will be spent at our Spiritual Park, having outdoor classes with Satguru Bodhinatha Veylanswami and the monks, exploring the park's paths, trees and river, meditating and enjoying the divine presence of the Deities. Once a month a large homa for Lord Panchamukha Ganapati is held at the park, drawing thousands of bhaktars from all over the island to receive His blessings. During our Innersearch program, we will have the opportunity to join in the monthly homa at the Spiritual Park on July 6. Be prepared to be amazed at how Gurudeva's little spiritual garden has become the venue for the largest monthly Hindu gathering in the country.

History of the Spiritual Park
</p>

<p>
In 1981 Gurudeva was called to Mauritius by elders who sought his help to strengthen the religion of their forefathers, protect it from aggressive incursions and engage the children. Gurudeva spent months visiting all corners of the island, immediately feeling a love for Mauritians. He returned again and again, eventually deciding to establish a Saiva Dharmashala, a small monastery, there.
</p>

<p>
The Spiritual Park began with a vision. Gurudeva shared: "In 1986 I had a powerful vision of Lord Ganesha while I was here in Mauritius looking for property for Saiva Siddhanta Church. Lord Ganesha was walking from His temple attended by two priests. He was about to take a bath in the beautiful Indian Ocean in the country of Mauritius where the river meets the sea. I was standing in the water with several sharks swimming around me. Lord Ganesha, accompanied by two priests, looked at me and said, 'Just rub some oil on their noses and they will not harm you.' The vision led me directly to this special land by the Rempart River and its lagoon. The Spiritual Park is a fulfillment of that vision. I see it combining environmental and architectural beauty that will give spiritual peace and mystical knowledge to visitors for many generations in the future. It is destined to become a pilgrimage site of great renown in the Indian Ocean area. Hindus from Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Africa and India will come here." And that look into the future has become a reality.
</p>

<p>
That same year, Gurudeva acquired riverside property, designating it as a monastery and converting the chalet-style bungalow on the west side into a monastic residence, where for years his monks lived and served. Later he dedicated six acres of his Saiva Dharmashala as a Spiritual Park. In 1999 he traveled to Mauritius to publicly inaugurate the Spiritual Park as a gift to the island nation. Today the park thrives as a religious center for all Mauritians.

Testimonial
</p>

<p>
We share the observations of one traveling devotee's recent experiences there:
</p>

<p>
"The Spiritual Park has really changed since 1986. The crowd at the monthly Ganesha homa was large. There are street vendors, just like in India, selling puja supplies along the approaching road. Our devotees here are just so enthusiastic, singing bhajans, chanting and everything else.
</p>

<p>
"Unlike at a temple, everyone gets to be close to Ganesha here, and the chanting is rhythmic and draws one inward. We couldn't believe the numbers of written prayers to be burned. Boxes and boxes full, not just thrown in loosely, but neatly stacked. With each mantra, they would take a large handful, dip them all in ghee and offer them to the flames within the huge homakunda. After the homa there is puja and arati, culminating the day's event.
</p>

<p>
"We visited the Spiritual Park three times since the first homa of the month. As with many temples, it was nice, with a big crowd, but just as pleasant with nobody there. The quietness of simply sitting in the mandapam with Ganesha, just you and Him, all surrounded by gentle misty rain and a cooling breeze, has such a cleansing and soothing effect. We are so lucky!
</p>

<p>
"The monthly homa at the Spiritual Park doesn't just draw one huge crowd at once that stays, but rather, has more of a constant wave, swelling to its maximum size around 11 am, when the homa is under way. One thing really stood out: our Church members really do a ton of work. The crowd is large, and each mandapam that shelters the people has a crew maintaining it. These helpers stay within the mandapams and gently help each devotee make their offerings, then return the tray with prasad. The young men at the Murugan Mandapam allowed me to help them for 15 or 20 minutes, so I got an opportunity to do some seva in this way.
</p>

<p>
"It's all quite remarkable how smoothly it runs. The Church's extended families, kutumbas, are assigned certain tasks, and each month someone takes care of their assigned area, be it sorting flowers at the main mandapam, constant, continuous cleanup at the Lingam, Dakshinamurti, Murugan, or smaller mandapams, singing, hooking up the speakers, guiding the crowd, collecting the prayers, helping in the mini-mela, selling and distributing religious literature, collecting funds for the proposed expansion, or any of several other necessary tasks that went unnoticed. Some members and friends come early at 6 am to set up and remain late to clean up, and with any crowd this size, there is inevitable cleanup. But a crew of about 100 to 200 souls somehow manages to help out and provide a wonderful spiritual event for maybe 10,000 or so pilgrims."

We'll see you all in Mauritius. Until then stay tuned for more news and information next month.
