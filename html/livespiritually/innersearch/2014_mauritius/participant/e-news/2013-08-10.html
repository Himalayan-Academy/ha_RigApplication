<h2 class="h2">E-news Update for August 10, 2013</h2>

<p>
Namaskaram, Innersearcher.
</p>

<p>
Technology is great when it works, isn't it? It didn't quite work out for our Google Group mailing list concept, so we have let go of that in favor of just a plain old email from us to you. No excessive infrastructure in between.
</p>

<p>
These Innersearch E-news Updates are the primary way we will keep you informed of important information you need to know as a program participant. We will send you informational emails about the program approximately once a month for the time being, increasing to once a week in the final months prior to the program, and perhaps more often when the occasion necessitates.
</p>

<p>
If you would like to connect with other participants prior to the program, you can do so on Facebook. Simply request to join our Innersearch Facebook Group <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/310582474757">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
We are excited to be conducting our first Innersearch Travel-Study Program in Mauritius, and doubly excited that you are going to be part of it. Stay tuned for upcoming updates that will share information about the hotel we have selected for the program, more about the gorgeous tropical island of Mauritius and our oceanfront Saiva Dharmashala and Spiritual Park where many of the program activities will take place.
</p>

<p>
As always, never hesitate to email, iMessage or call if you have any questions.
</p>

<p>
Best regards from Kauai's Hindu Monastery. Aum shanti.
