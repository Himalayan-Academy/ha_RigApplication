Namaskaram from Kauai island, Innersearcher!
</p>

<p>
We must love islands. Next year's Innersearch Travel-Study Program to the lovely island/nation of Mauritius promises to be one of our sweetest. Less grueling travel, more upanishadic time with Bodhinatha and the swamis at our very own Spiritual Park. As you make soft plans for next July, we thought to let you see Mauritius through the eyes of one of our members from North America who visited recently, giving a glimpse into the experiences that await us:
</p>

<p>
"The entire island is like the planet’s little secret. It’s so out of the way of anything, small enough to go unnoticed by all but a few, yet just so remarkable in so many ways; not the least of which, it is a place where different ethnicities live side by side. Mauritian hospitality is wonderful, a model of harmony for the planet. In three months of travel we witnessed only three incidents of disharmony.
</p>

<p>
"The Siva temples are powerful and plentiful, though those built here are all small by the Indian standards of Chidambaram or Tanjore. Still, each has a nice vibration. They tend to the sizes of North American temples or slightly larger and are often open-air. The Spiritual Park is, of course, a wonderful sight to behold, especially during the monthly Ganesha homa, which draws thousands of the island's people. To the Southwest, at the Grand Bassin Lake, one can witness a massive standing statue of Siva. On festival days the area hums with activity. This lake is the Ganga of Mauritius.
</p>

<p>
"Everywhere you go, people know of Gurudeva and Bodhinatha. A restaurant might have a Ganesha from the Spiritual Park installed in a shrine out front, or you'll find that the murti of the nearby temple was a gift from Gurudeva. Many stores will have pictures of Pancha Ganapati at the Spiritual Park, and the best part is that it's all so natural. It's just a normal day in the life of the island and our lineage.
</p>

<p>
"On practicality, Mauritius is different than some places. The evenings get quieter, quicker. Businesses close and things quiet down, with the exception of larger tourist areas and a few larger stores. For the most part, around dusk life is far less hectic. Streets are emptier and there are few people out. This is in contrast to the cities of India or North America. Busses and most cabs are unavailable after 6pm, so the traveller has to be aware of this and plan accordingly. Though it does help to know some French, compared to traveling in India, Mauritius is a breeze. It’s also substantially cleaner. The public bus system is excellent and very cost-effective.
</p>

<p>
"And how could one go without mentioning the beaches? They are some of the most beautiful and colorful in the world, with bright green African waters and warm sand. Here on Mauritius, Hinduism flourishes in all its splendor, unhindered by the dissension of imposing cultures and the rest of the world's confusions. It's a place of relaxed beauty and true devotion, an oasis of grand temples and heavenly horizons."
</p>

<p>
We look forward to seeing you there!

Stay tuned for more news and information next month.

Best regards from Kauai's Hindu Monastery. Aum shanti.
