<h1 class="h1">Innersearch Mauritius 2014</h1>

<h2 class="h2">E-news Update for April 27, 2014</h2>

<p>
Namaskaram, Innersearchers!
</p>

<p>
There are only about nine weeks to go before we’ll be seeing each other on <i>la belle Île Maurice.</i>
</p>

<h3>
Satguru Purnima Gifts 
</h3>

<p>
As you may be aware, Satguru Purnima will take place during this Innersearch program. While it is customary to present the guru with a special gift during this festival, we propose that you hold off on doing so. For those who wish to contribute, during the program we will organize a single collective gift, which everyone may offer together on this extraordinary day. The staff’s luggage will fit under the airplanes a bit easier on the way back to Kauai, too! 
</p>

<h3>
An Important Request for Input 
</h3>

<p>
One of the swamis will be giving two classes on the topics of your choice. Please email your topics or questions to <a href="mailto:senthil@hindu.org">senthil@hindu.org</a> by May 4, and we will select those that are not already part of the content of other classes.
</p>

<h3>
Hotel Information
</h3>

<p>
Lastly, a bit more information we’re sure you’ll all want to know about the hotel: Wired internet access, printing and faxing facilities are available in the hotel's business center. Wi-Fi is also available in the hotel lobby and the conference center where we will be having some of our morning and evening activities, but it will not be available in individual rooms. The hotel maintains a health and fitness suite that participants are free to use during periods when Innersearch activities are not taking place.
</p>

<p>
Stay tuned for more information about the hotel’s facilities in future editions of this e-newsletter.
