<h1 class="h1">Innersearch Mauritius 2014</h1>

<h2 class="h2">E-news Update for March 9, 2014</h2>

<p>
Namaste and Aloha Innersearchers,
</p>

<p>
There are just four months until we will all be meeting together on the island of Mauritius, a place which possesses a unique mix of European and Hindu culture, resulting in a marvelous social ambiance that can only be experienced by being there. But this isn't just an average vacation. It's not just a time to relax on the beach and eat tasty food (though there will be plenty of that!). Rather, the focus of this Innersearch is you. It is a time to transplant yourself into two weeks of sadhana, worship, meditation and a great deal of fun, as you cultivate your inner explorations, accompanied by experts in the task.
</p>

<p>
It is our day-to-day lives that tell us who we are; it is our comparisons with the people and things around us that help us to define our external selves. These weeks with Satguru Bodhinatha Veylanswami, his monks and other like-minded seekers will be a time removed from the you that you have built yourself to be. And hopefully, you will take a step closer to who you really are. The journey ahead will be a grand pilgrimage. But remember, a pilgrimage is not always easy. Travel is full of its surprises and unexpected challenges. So, expect to be challenged, for this is what fuels our inner growth. After all, growth is the central purpose of this great adventure.

Gurudeva had more than a few nice words about the special experience of going on pilgrimage. Here is some of what he wrote in "Merging with Siva:"
</p>

<p>
"To keep the colors of our subconscious and subsubconscious refined, our religion tells us to go on a long pilgrimage once a year. This means we take our inner aura that has been building up through the year and place it at the feet of the Deity at some far-off temple. While on the pilgrimage, we are able to collect all its colors, emotions and deep feelings and leave them, along with our offering of fruit and flowers, at the God’s holy feet to be disintegrated by Him. So great are the Gods of our religion.
</p>

<p>
"In our religious life, one of the most fulfilling aspects is pilgrimage. We have a joy in looking forward to a spiritual journey, and we experience a contentment while on our pilgrimage and later bask in the glowing aftermath of the pujas. It is like going to see a great friend, a devotee’s most loved friend—the Ishta Devata. We travel to the far-off temple where this great friend is eminently present. At that particular temple, this personal God performs a certain function, offers a specific type of blessing to pilgrims who make the pilgrimage to that home. In this way, different temples become famous for answering certain types of prayers, such as requests for financial help, or prayers for the right mate in marriage, prayers to be entrusted with the raising of high-souled children, or help in matters of yoga, or help in inspiring bhakti and love.
</p>

<p>
"The Hindu does not have the feeling of having to take a vacation to 'get away from it all.' We don’t lead a life of mental confusions, religious contradictions and the frustrations that result from modern hurried living. We lead a moderate life, a religious life. In living a moderate life, we then look at our pilgrimage as a special moment, a cherished time of setting ordinary concerns aside and giving full stage to our religious longings. It is a time to take problems and prayers to our personal God.
</p>

<p>
"All in life that one would want to 'get away from' the Hindu takes with him on a pilgrimage to the temple, to the feet of his personal God, to the inner-plane being or Mahadeva, who needs no physical body with which to communicate with people—to the God who has a nerve system so sensitive and well developed that as it hovers over the stone image, which looks similar to how the Deity would look on the inner planes, this being of light can communicate with the pilgrims who visit the temple. This being of light, this Mahādeva, can and does absorb all of the dross the devotees have to offer, and gives back blessings which bring happiness and release to them. Thus, the pilgrimage is not travel in the ordinary sense of travel, but rather going to see a personal friend, one who is nearest and dearest, but does not live in a physical body.
</p>

<p>
"Life is a pilgrimage to mukti, or liberation from rebirth, which once attained is the end to reincarnation in a physical body. When on a holy pilgrimage, one would not want to hurt anyone along the way, knowing full well the experiences on this path are of one’s own creation, though maybe acted out through others."

With lots of aloha from the Innersearch team at Kauai's Hindu Monastery. Aum shanti.
