<h2 class="h2">E-news Update for November 6, 2013</h2>

<p>
Namaskaram, Innersearchers!
</p>

<h3 class="h3">
ACCOMMODATIONS
</h5>

<p>
We are happy to announce that the hotel for our days on the tropical island of Mauritius has been selected. We will be sojourning at the Jalsa Beach Hotel and Spa in Poste Lafayette. We are fortunate to have our hotel right on the beach and so close to the Spiritual Park, just a 15-18 minute ride away. 
</p>

<p>
The group booking covered by your program fees includes 12 nights, checking in on July 2 and checking out on July 14, 2014.
</p>

<p>
If you plan to arrive in Mauritius early, or stay late, please let us know as soon as possible, including whether you would like to spend your extra nights at this hotel. We need to let the hotel know about any participants who are arriving earlier or staying later, and such additional nights will need to be paid for separately, directly to the hotelâ€”they are not covered by the program fees. We are doing our best to ensure that additional nights are reasonably priced, and we will inform participants who need this information as soon as we have it.
</p>

<p>
A reasonable amount of information about the hotel is available on <a href="http://www.jalsabeach.com/">its website</a>.
If you have any questions about the hotel, please send me an email and I will get you an answer.

BOOKING YOUR FLIGHTS
</h3>

<p>
Now is a good time to book your flights to and from the Sri Seewoosagur Ramgoolam International Airport in Mauritius (airport code MRU). Here are some important notes to consider:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Please arrange for an inbound flight that arrives no later than 2:00 pm on July 2 and an outbound flight that departs no earlier than 2:00 pm on July 14. This will ensure that you will arrive in time to attend the entire opening activity (orientation and dinner starting at 5:00 pm on July 2) and be able to depart after the end of the closing activity of the program (our traditional Aloha Breakfast ending at 10:00 am on July 14). Note that ground transportation between the airport and hotel takes a minimum of one hour, and this does not count time for immigration, baggage collection and customs upon arrival, or for check-in, security checkpoint and boarding upon departure. This is why we are recommending a minimum three-hour buffer for your arrival and four-hour buffer for your departure.</li>
	<li>Depending on where you are coming from, as many as two days' travel may be required to reach Mauritius. In our experience, the travel can typically be done all at once or by splitting the itinerary and stopping to spend a night somewhere part-way.</li>
	<li>Routing for flights to Mauritius can change depending on the day of the week and the point of origin or connection (i.e., from certain origin or connection cities, direct flights are available only certain days of the week, and airlines may partner with other airlines on flights via a connecting city, sometimes very far away, on other days of the week). This can sometimes impact the fare significantly, so it is good to look into a variety of possible start dates for your outbound travel.</li>
	<li>Once you have booked your flights, be sure to let the program coordinator know your arrival and departure date, time, airline name and flight number. This information is required for the arrangement of ground transportation and for the rooming list.</li>
</ul>

<p>
On our <a href="http://www.himalayanacademy.com/livespiritually/innersearch/2014_mauritius/participant/">Innersearch participant information website</a>, you will find some updated, basic information about the flight routes known to us, to get you started in your planning. This is not meant to take the place of expert advice from a professional travel agent. Unless you are departing from a city served by Air Mauritius (which dramatically simplifies matters), we highly recommend that you consult with a travel agent (if you don't have one you already work with, the contacts for two that we use are also on the website below), your preferred major carrier and/or one or more online travel booking services to compare prices and routes before booking your travel. Again, please refer to the notes above and be sure to schedule your flights so that you arrive in time for the start of the program and depart sufficiently after the end of the program. We don't want you to miss anything!

With lots of aloha from the Innersearch team at Kauai's Hindu Monastery. Aum shanti.
