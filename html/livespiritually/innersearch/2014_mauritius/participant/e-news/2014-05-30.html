<h2 class="h2">E-news Update for May 30, 2014</h2>

<p>
Aloha, Innersearchers!
</p>

<p>
With just over a month to go until we are all together in Mauritius, the journey's reality is nearing. The staff would like to encourage each of you to put into practice our next Innersearch Preparation Sadhana. This sadhana involves updating your 3-year plan—or writing it if you don't currently have one—a list of compartmentalized goals that you would like to accomplish throughout the next three years; because life doesn't end with this spectacular adventure, but continues on with many, many more to come!
</p>

<p>
As with the Vasana Daha Tantra, by which you will have cleared your subconscious of the past, the creation of this three year plan will help relieve your anticipations of the future. With the completion of these two personal sadhanas, you will be able to be as present as possible during this Innersearch.
</p>

<p>
We ask that you bring a physical copy of your Three Year Plan with you to Mauritius. It will be a necessary item for one of the swami's classes.
