<h1 class="h1">Innersearch Mauritius 2014</h1>

<h2 class="h2">E-news Update for June 29, 2014</h2>

<p>Bonjour, Innersearchers!</p>

<p>Greetings from the resplendent isle of Mauritius, where over 350 of the country's over 1,600 subscribers have gathered with us for a special event showcasing Hinduism Today at a high-tech venue in the west-central region of the island.</p>

<p>This morning we visited the Spiritual Park to see progress on preparations being made for the Innersearch. We want to keep most of it a surprise for you all, but we thought you would enjoy this photo of a family we found performing abhishekam at the Narmada Lingam shrine just up the bank from the river. Being a Sunday, a constant stream of devotees from all over the island was moving through our idyllic seaside park in a relaxed way.</p>

<p>A heads-up we thought it prudent to pass along: a water-borne illness, unusual for this developed nation, recently swept through some parts of the island. Thus, it is best to avoid drinking the tap water. Bottled water will be provided in the hotel rooms and during activities and outings throughout the Innersearch.</p>

<p>Last but not least, we have acquired local mobile phone numbers. If you need to call or text, you may reach Senthilnathaswami on +230-5253-0615 or Sadhaka Rajanatha on +230-5253-0601.</p>

<p>If you are not already on the island, have a safe trip! We'll see you soon.</p>

<p>Aum Namah Sivaya</p>
