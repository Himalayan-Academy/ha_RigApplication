<h1 class="h1">Innersearch Mauritius 2014</h1>

<h2 class="h2">E-news Update for August 23, 2014</h2>

<p>Namaste Innersearchers!</p>

<p>This will most likely be our final Innersearch Mauritius 2014 e-news to all of you.</p>

<p>Once again, thank you all for a wonderful program! We have been hearing nothing but positive and loving feedback about how this Innersearch has changed the lives of all those involved.</p>

<p>You will be happy to know that we have completed a collection of media from the program to share with you.</p>

<p>A Dropbox folder has been set up with select photos taken by the staff throughout the program, including a subfolder containing the family and individual portrait shots taken with Bodhinatha. You’ll also see a few audio files. </p>

<p>If there are any events for which you would like to see more photos, just ask, and we will place more in the Dropbox folder. We also have a good amount of unedited video footage. Should you desire video from a certain event, let us know and we’ll do our best to provide it in a reasonable amount of time. </p>

<p>For those of you interested in the iPad apps that Saravananathaswami presented during the meditation classes, he has posted a YouTube video of the chakras and simshumbisi illustration made in the Forge of Neon app. This can be used as a guide to create the illustration yourself on your iPad. See it <a href="http://youtu.be/COz1An2tNrc">here</a>.</p>

<p>Follow <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/oognh07jxuodqlr/AADZ05Idac9aytw3XuPQMl80a?dl=0">this link</a> to access select photos from Innersearch along with other media.</p>

<p>Remember the Innersearch compilation video we played during the Grand Finale Banquet? That was just a rough edit. This video has been finalized and can now be seen <a href="http://www.himalayanacademy.com/blog/taka/2014/08/21/2014-innersearch-mauritius-complilation-video/">here</a>.</p>

<p>You may find the recorded audio from all of the satsangs with Bodhinatha and Sadasivanathaswami at <a href="http://www.himalayanacademy.com/site/search/query/mauclass2014%2C/page/1/sort/alpha-ascending">this link</a>.</p>

<p>Last but not least, informal conversations are still taking place regarding the next Innersearch. As soon as we make a firm decision and have information to share about when and where it will take place, you all will be the first to know!</p>

<p>Best regards from Kauai's Hindu Monastery.   </p>
