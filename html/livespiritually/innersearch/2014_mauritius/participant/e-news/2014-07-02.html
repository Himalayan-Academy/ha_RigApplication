<h2 class="h2">E-news Update for July 2, 2014</h2>

<p>Bienvenue, Innersearchers!</p>

<p>It is our great pleasure to welcome you to this beautiful island today. By now, you have all arrived, and the last few will be settled in our gorgeous seaside home by this afternoon. </p>

<p>Our program begins this evening at 5:00 pm sharp. Please come a few minutes early to the hotel's Hartopp Restaurant entrance and follow the sign to the stairs that will lead you to the second level, which has been set aside for our group for the duration of our program. Upstairs you will need to proceed through our restaurant and then head up a few steps and through the double doors into the conference hall. This is our Crow's Nest!</p>

<p>See you all soon. </p>
