<h1 class="h1">Innersearch Mauritius 2014</h1>

<h2 class="h2">E-news Update for June 19, 2014</h2>

<h3>
Updated Airport Pick-up Information (please re-read carefully)
</h3>

<p>
Transportation between the airport and the hotel has been arranged for all Innersearchers, regardless of arrival or departure gate. Upon arrival, following immigration, baggage claim and customs, please proceed to Exit 7 (not 27), counter no. 25, where a representative named Amar from Seaside Holidays will greet you and show you to the vehicle for your transfer to Jalsa Beach Hotel. A signboard reading "Innersearch 2014" will be present at the counter for clarity. 
</p>

<h3>
Ramadan at DBX
</h3>

<p>
For those who are transiting through Dubai, note that you will be doing so during the month of Ramadan, when a national policy prohibits eating and drinking (even water) in public from sunrise to sunset. Most of the restaurants in the airport are not open until after sunset during this month, but there may be a few. They are not so strict about tourists drinking water in the airport. If you are exiting the airport for any reason, avoid drinking water out on the street. However, it is okay in hotels.
</p>

<h3>
First Innersearch Activity
</h3>

<p>
At 5:00pm on July 2nd will all gather for our traditional Crow's Nest meeting, the first official event of our Innersearch program. It will take place in the Jalsa Beach Hotel's Conference Room, which is upstairs in the restaurant building. This will be a time of welcome, introductions and some basic coordination for the next day. Dinner will follow.
</p>

<h3>
Preparation Sadhana
</h3>

<p>
For your next Innersearch preparation sadhana, we suggest that you listen to these recordings by Gurudeva. One for each of the next nine days.

<h3>
A Brief Reminder of Our Ground Rules
</h3>

<ol>
	<li>No smoking during group activities or at any time at the Spiritual Park. At the hotel, please take care to obey signage indicating where smoking may be allowed or disallowed.</li>
	<li>No hard liquor. Wine and beer are OK, however, no alcohol will be served during group meals. It is okay to have alcohol on your own, later, and on your own bill. Extra drinks ordered during group meals will not be covered by the Innersearch.</li>
	<li>No illegal drugs.</li>
	<li>No shorts, short-dresses or tank tops. Long pants or dresses and kurta or polo shirts are encouraged for excursions.</li>
	<li>Hindu dress is strongly encouraged for classes with the swamis and temple events.</li>
	<li>If you visit the hotel pool, please wear modest attire (no bikinis).</li>
</ol>

<p>
You may also be interested to know that Mauritius has a non-tipping culture and if you tip it will be awkward for the servers. However, a hearty thank you for good service is always welcomed.
