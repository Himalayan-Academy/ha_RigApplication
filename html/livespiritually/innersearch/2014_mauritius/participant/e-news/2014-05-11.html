<h1 class="h1">Innersearch Mauritius 2014</h1>

<h2 class="h2">E-news Update for May 11, 2014</h2>

<p>
Namaskaram, Innersearchers!
</p>

<p>
Just over seven weeks to our first day together in Mauritius!
</p>

<p>
As Gurudeva said time and time again, the purpose of your being on this planet is to realize the Self, to realize your Divinity. This program is just one experience in the beautiful infinity of your evolution. However small, it is an important one. Gathering together with like-minded souls, each of whom is ready, like you, to move closer to that Ultimate Goal, this journey will be much deeper than the sights, sounds and experiences we will share, whether you consciously realize it or not. So, with a light heart, a steadied mind and the will to improve on your perfection, we are expecting great things from this unusual adventure together.
</p>

<p>
We invite you to read the following excerpt from Gurudeva's Living with Siva about life's loftiest goal:
</p>

<p style="padding:0 35px 0 35px;">
To know philosophy without experience is like going on a vacation to a distant and wonderful place by simply reading a book about the destination, hearing what others claim is to be enjoyed there. It is not true experience at all. The only spiritual experience is personal experience. My satguru, Siva Yogaswami, made it clear that "You will not attain jnana, wisdom, even if you read a thousand scriptures. You must know your Self by yourself." How can we with our finite mind come to understand infinity, come to understand God?
</p>

<p style="padding:0 35px 0 35px;">
How can we intellectually encompass something as great as God? Our scriptures tell us that God Himself is Shankara, the author of all knowledge, creator of the intellect. He is the great architect of the universe. Then if God created the intellect, how can the intellect understand Him? Well, it is possible. It has been done. The intellect has to expand, and awareness has to transcend the rational mind and see directly from superconscious knowing. That is why we worship Siva in His highest form, symbolized by the Sivalinga, the simple elliptical stone.
</p>

<p style="padding:0 35px 0 35px;">
It is good that you are trying to see Siva everywhere. Keep trying. It will come. Who else can give your Self to you? The unfoldment of the Self within you is but Siva. He can give you wealth. He can give you health. He can bestow everything that you would ever need or even desire. But to worship Him as formless carries the mind into infinity. Mind can only encompass what it identifies with. Mind cannot identify Truth in this subtle form which represents Siva as beyond the mind--formless, timeless and spaceless. Yet, within you this very instant, only shrouded by your ignorance, only shrouded by the ego, which is the sense of personal identity and separation, is Siva. He is there right now, not at some fictitious future time. Just get rid of the maya, the anava and resolve the karma, and there He will be. The ego is the last thing to go. It is the last bond to break.
</p>

<p style="padding:0 35px 0 35px;">
Once the bondage of personal ego is broken, it is seen that this mysterious God is all-pervading. He is what He has created. Think about that. It is very deep. Siva pervades His creation constantly as ever-present Love and Light of the mind of everyone, as Intelligence and Being; and yet God also has a form.
</p>

<p style="padding:0 35px 0 35px;">
In the subtle worlds, Siva has the most beautiful form, not unlike a human form, but an absolutely perfect human form. He thinks. He talks. He walks. He makes decisions. We are fortunate to worship such a great God who pervades everything and yet transcends it, who is both form and beyond form, who is the Self within your very self at this very moment. So, all of you seekers of nondual Truth, you have a truly great path that offers God experience in form and beyond form. How fortunate you are!
