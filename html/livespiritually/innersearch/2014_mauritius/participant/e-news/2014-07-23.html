<h1 class="h1">Innersearch Mauritius 2014</h1>

<h2 class="h2">E-news Update for July 23, 2014</h2>

<p>Aloha Innersearchers,</p>

<p>Thank you all for your participation in what was one of our most life-changing and love-filled Innersearches ever!</p>

<p>We hope you all had a safe and pleasant journey home, and we are enjoying the stories of how life has changed in ten nations after Innersearch. The monks are almost fully adjusted to being back at Kauai Aadheenam, on the other side of the planet. We, too, are still feeling the uplifting energy that all of you helped to create during our weeks together. </p>

<h3 class="h3">Downloading Photos & Videos from Your iPad</h3>

<p><a href="/html/livespiritually/innersearch/2014_mauritius/participant/e-news/Himalayan_Academy_iPad_Study_Guide_v1.2.pdf">This PDF</a> explains some details about syncing your iPad, as well as instructions for extracting the many photos and videos you took while on Innersearch. Please read it carefully. Unfortunately, we are unable to provide technical support for this process beyond what our trusty San Francisco based IT consultants have collected in this PDF. If you require assistance, hopefully a young friend or family member—or a Google search—could locate the answers.</p>

<p>Speaking of photos and videos, we are in the process of assembling a compilation of ours and yours to share with everyone. If you would like to submit photos and videos for the compilation, please contact Sadhaka Jayanatha at jaya@hindu.org. It's good to avoid emailing your photos and videos; Sadhaka would be happy to discuss various options for how to transport them to us.</p>

<h3 class="h3">TAKA Stories on the Innersearch</h3>

<p>Kulamata Moilavadee Moorghen wrote a story about our visit to the President of Mauritius on the 9th of July, appearing on our blog <a href="http://www.himalayanacademy.com/blog/taka/2014/07/22/a-courtesy-visit-to-the-president/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Many other slideshows and stories about our journey have appeared on the monastery blog lately, so have a look through the past few weeks of posts if you haven’t already.</p>

<p>Last, but not least, one way we can all say thanks to our amazing staff at the Jalsa Beach Hotel is to take a few minutes to post a review for the hotel on TripAdvisor, which will help their future business. You can do so <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1182893-d1630748-Reviews-Jalsa_Beach_Hotel_Spa_Mauritius-Poste_Lafayette.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Aum Namah Sivaya!</p>
