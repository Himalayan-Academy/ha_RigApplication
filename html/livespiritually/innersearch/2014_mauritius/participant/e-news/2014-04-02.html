<h1 class="h1">Innersearch Mauritius 2014</h1>

<h2 class="h2">E-news Update for April 2, 2014</h2>

<p>
Namaskaram from Kauai island, Innersearchers!
</p>

<p>
Today we cross the 3-month mark and our Innersearch program details are starting to come together. We're happy to be able to tease you with the prospect of some delightful experiences we have planned for our pilgrims. In true Innersearch form, we won't disclose details of our planned activities until the evening before each day! This keeps us all in the now, which is different from being in the know.

First up in this e-news are a few housekeeping items:
</p>

<p>
1. If you have yet to book your travel to Mauritius, now would be an excellent time. As far as we can tell, airfares around the dates of the program are currently lower than they were several months ago, so it's a buyer's market. Please arrange for an inbound flight that arrives no later than 2:00 pm on July 2 and an outbound flight that departs no earlier than 2:00 pm on July 14. For more information, visit the "Getting to Mauritius" section of our website for program participants <a href="http://www.himalayanacademy.com/livespiritually/innersearch/2014_mauritius/participant/">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
2. Please let us know as soon as possible the airline, flight number, date and time of your inbound and outbound flights to/from Mauritius. If it's easy, you can feel free to forward your flight confirmation email to us, and we will identify the information we need within it. This is crucial in order to arrange ground transportation to the hotel as well as any extra nights you may want to stay at the hotel before and/or after the program.

We would like to leave you today with a beautiful article by Vel Mahalingum, a senior member of Saiva Siddhanta Church in Mauritius, about Gurudeva's powerfully positive influence on the island and its people. Here is a short excerpt:
</p>

<p>
Subramuniyaswami beckoned, "Learn your religion well; build walls of intelligence around yourselves and your community. Understand the treasure you possess so well that no one can convince you otherwise. Be clear in your beliefs. Put the tenets into practice so you experience directly the blessings that are your birthright. Then, when converters come to your door, tell them, 'I am sure your religion is a good one, but I also have a wonderful religion that fulfills me entirely. Thank you very much and good bye.'" He spoke to us like that, so simply, so directly and with such power. It was something new, a message we had never heard before. One person observed, even back then, "He has just made us conversion-proof."
