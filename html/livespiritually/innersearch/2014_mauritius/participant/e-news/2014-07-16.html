<h1 class="h1">Innersearch Mauritius 2014</h1>

<h2 class="h2">E-news Update for July 16, 2014</h2>

<p>Bonjour, Innersearchers!</p>

<p>The staff is currently in Singapore visiting with devotees here and catching up a bit before returning to Kauai tomorrow. We hope those of you who have departed Mauritius have reached home safely and happily.</p>

<p>We would like to remind you to not connect your iPad to your computer until you receive our instructional PDF about how to download the photos and videos you took on the iPad prior to its being erased. You may recall that we announced during the Crow's Nest orientation gathering that, due to Apple's strict security policy, when you connect an iPad to iTunes on a computer that is signed in to a different iTunes account (yours) than the one the iPad is signed into (ours), it will erase the iPad's contents and you will be forced to set it up as a fresh, new device.</p>

<p>We should have these instructions to you within a week.</p>

<p>Thus, please do not sync your Innersearch iPad to iTunes until you have read our upcoming PDF.</p>

<p>Thank you, and we will be in touch again soon after we return to beautiful Kauai.</p>

<p>Aum Namah Sivaya</p>
