<h2 class="h2">Getting There</h2>

<p>The entire program will take place on the beautiful island of Mauritius. You will need to book your own flights to and from the Sri Seewoosagur Ramgoolam International Airport in Mauritius—airport code MRU—to attend the program.</p>

<h5 class="h5">Important notes to consider when booking your flights:</h5>

<ul>
	<li>Please arrange for an inbound flight that arrives <u>no later than 2:00 pm</u> on July 2 and an outbound flight that departs <u>no earlier than 2:00 pm</u> on July 14. This will ensure that you will arrive in enough time to attend the entire opening activity (orientation and dinner starting at 5:00 pm on July 2) and be able to depart after the end of the closing activity of the program (Aloha breakfast ending at 10:00 am on July 14). For your reference, note that ground transportation between the airport and hotel takes a minimum of one hour, and this does not count time for immigration, baggage collection and customs upon arrival, or for check-in, security checkpoint and boarding upon departure. This is why we are recommending a minimum three-hour buffer for your arrival and four-hour buffer for your departure.</li>
	<li>Depending on where you are coming from, as many as two days' travel may be required to reach Mauritius. In our experience, the travel can typically be done all at once or by splitting the itinerary and stopping to spend a night somewhere part-way.</li>
	<li>Routing for flights to Mauritius can change depending on the day of the week and the point of origin or connection (i.e., from certain origin or connection cities, direct flights are  available only certain days of the week, and airlines may partner with other airlines on flights via a connecting city, sometimes very far away, on other days of the week). This can sometimes impact the fare significantly, so it is good to look into a variety of possible start dates for your outbound travel.</li>
	<li>Once you have booked your flights, be sure to let the program coordinator know your arrival and departure date, time, airline name and flight number. This information is required for the arrangement of ground transportation and for the room list.</li>
</ul>

<p>Below is some basic information about the flight routes known to the Innersearch Coordinator, to get you started in your planning. This is not meant to take the place of expert advice from a professional travel agent. Unless you are departing from a city served by <a href="http://www.airmauritius.com/">Air Mauritius</a></li> (which dramatically simplifies matters), we still highly recommend that you consult with a travel agent, such as one listed below, your preferred major carrier and/or one or more online travel booking services to compare prices and routes before booking your travel. Again, please refer to the notes above and be sure to schedule your flights so that you arrive in time for the program start.</p>
