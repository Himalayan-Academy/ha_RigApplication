<h2 class="h2">Basic Information</h2>

<p>Please check back here occasionally for updates. We will be sure to mark what is <b>NEW</b> so that it is obvious.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Preparation</h3>

<p>As part of our preparation for the journey, we are encouraging everyone to start reading Gurudeva's daily Master Course lessons, if you are not doing so already. The daily lessons will help you set a nice foundation to have some wonderful inner experiences in the classes and temples in Mauritius. They will also bring you into the inner-plane schools at night as the program approaches. You may read the lessons from the books if you have them, <a href="/livespiritually/become-student/todays-lesson">online</a>, or you may subscribe to the <a href="http://www.feedblitz.com/f/?Sub=&Publisher=7522423&portal=331383">free daily e-mail</a>. (On the e-mail subscription page, you may wish to uncheck all the options except "The Master Course," unless, of course, you would like to subscribe to the other newsletters.)</p>

<p>We encourage everyone to join our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/310582474757/">Innersearch Facebook Group</a> to begin to get to know your fellow participants. The Facebook Group is also a place where you can connect with other participants coming from your area. Mauritius may be very far away from where you live; it may be possible, not to mention fun, to arrange for travel along the same route and dates as other participants from your country or region. </p>

<h3 class="h3">Fitness Guidelines</h3>

<p>
In order to participate fully in this journey you will need an average level of fitness. A typical day will see us rising early for hatha yoga, then sharing morning and afternoon classes, lunch and dinner together. The nature of the journey involves traveling on some days by bus and boats. You will generally find your days fully scheduled and fairly long.
</p>

<h3 class="h3">Health</h3>

You should be in good health to satisfactorily participate in this tour. Please advise Himalayan Academy of any pre-existing medical conditions which may limit or prohibit your full participation. All applicants should consider their personal ability and comfort levels with regards to the itinerary. Please do not hesitate to contact us to discuss the nature of the journey and any concerns you may have.
