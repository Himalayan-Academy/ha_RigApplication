<h2 class="h2">What to Pack <b>(NEW)</b></h2>

<p>It's never too early to think about packing. Here is a short list of basic items that we suggest bringing with you to Mauritius. Those of us coming from the Northern Hemisphere must be reminded that July means winter in Mauritius. For the month, the average low is 16&deg;C (60&deg;F), and the average high is 22&deg;C (72&deg;F).
</p>

<p>
Keep in mind that this is just a preliminary list of suggestions for you to blend in to your usual personal packing list.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Flight itineraries, confirmation numbers and boarding passes</li>
	<li>Local ID and passport</li>
	<li>One or two light jackets, sweaters and/or warm shawls</li>
	<li>Proper attire for three temple visits</li>
	<li>Proper attire for two formal dinner occasions (preferably Indian, but Western is okay, too)</li>
	<li>Small day bag for outings</li>
	<li>Modest swimsuit (no bikinis)</li>
	<li>Proper walking/hiking shoes</li>
	<li>Casual footwear, such as sandals</li>
	<li>Sun hat</li>
	<li>Sunglasses</li>
	<li>Sunscreen</li>
	<li>Mosquito repellent</li>
	<li>Travel umbrella</li>	
	<li>Any personal medications that you need</li>
	<li>Electrical plug adapter for any devices you may be bringing, such as a laptop, mobile phone</li>
	<li>Water bottle (for most outings, plastic water bottles will be available)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Please note that Hindu dress is encouraged for classes, meals, temple visits and other important occasions, but it is not required. Smart casual and formal Western attire, each for their respective occasions, are fine if you do not have traditional Indian clothes. Long pants or dresses and kurta or polo shirts are encouraged for excursions. Please, no shorts, short-dresses or tank tops.

<p>
We encourage everybody to travel light. You will be required to carry your own luggageâ€”for example on and off the bus into the hotel. A good test after you have packed is to carry your bags (including all daypacks, jackets and camera cases!) for 100 meters. If you have any difficulty, we would recommend a re-pack and exploring luggage with wheels! You should not expect other group members to assist with your baggage.
