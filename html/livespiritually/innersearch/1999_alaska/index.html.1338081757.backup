							<span class="gentxt">Gurudeva writes: &quot;I have just recently returned from Innersearch Alaska, 1999. Forty-two of us sailed from Vancouver to Anchorage, 1,500 miles of incredible scenery and spriitual sharing. At the culmination, we founded the first Ganesha Temple in the state and made lasting connections with the native Indians of Alaska. It was our first time on cruise ship. But it won't be the last, for we all had the time of our life. Below is the family portrait, taken when we docked at Juneau for a day to visit the glaciers! Don't you wish you were there?&quot;</span><br>
