<h1>Livecode at Himalayan Academy Publications</h1>

<p>Himalayan Academy Publications, run by the monks of Kauai's Hindu Monastery, uses LiveCode in a big way to meet their publications goals. The production manager, who codes the apps with the help of Andre Garzia from Brazil says, "As early as 1995 we began the transition from strictly print to digital with with the first Hindu web sites on the internet. I had a background in Hypercard and Supercard on the Mac, but when Livecode came on the scene in the late 1990's it was a eureka day for me because now we had a tool box that could leverage the desktop, our local network and our web server in a seamless framework. I was also confident that since this programming environment was based on xTalk, which has been with us since 1983, that we could invest our time and money in a product that would be with us for decades while other tools come and go. Keep up a daily blogs which include photos and text arriving in at our media studio from points all over the world was a challenge we could not meet without Livecode. The wonder is that I'm not a professional programmer but Livecode allows me to get tools we need up and running in days in instead of weeks. And then we continually refine them as we go because of the absence of the painful compile/run cycle. Our in-house apps are constantly evolving to meet the needs of the day.</p>

<h2> Caption Writer</h2>

<p>We keep a central folder on the LAN server where content contributor drop photo sets. We can point Caption Writer to anyone of these folders and the interface allows for the editor to write captions for each photo, a story for the gallery and then with the click of a button all the html and javascript require for a Galleria slideshow post is generated by LiveCode. The app automotically opens WordPress on the server with the post sitting on the clipboard ready to go.
All the slideshow posts at http://www.himalayanacademy.com/taka are generated by LiveCode.</p>

<h2>Hindu Press International</h2>

<p>One of our web sites is for our international magazine Hinduism Today and this site carries a popular blog called Hindu Press International which aggregates key news items. We have a very lean simple desk top app for editors who don't need to know anything about HTML, FTP. They simply enter stories into a single field and the application parses the stories, generates the blog post, uses XML-RPC to push the post to the web server where XOOPS picks it up and it's instantly on line. </p>

<h2>ATRA- Audio Transcriber</h2>
<img src="/html/info/livecode-in-action/audio-transcriber.jpg" alt="audio-transcriber"  class="float-left"/>
<p>We publish lectures by our seniors online. One of the requirements is to have the audio transcribed. For nearly a decade we have been using a LiveCode app that is distributed to staff in several countries. We put MP3 audio recordings on the web server in directories for each of these volunteers. ATRA is a stand alone app that allows them to access their directory of audio files, download them, manage them locally on their hard drive, and load up and transcribe the audio. A spell check dynamically downloads dictionaries from the web server and I can see what words are being mis-spelled or questioned and up-date the dictionaries, which are then instantly updated for all users, wherever they may be. When the user finishes the transcript, they post it to our webserver as an XML files (the user does not have to do any mark up) and the app sends me a notification. Here at the media studio I have another LiveCode app that reads the xml and using xsl, it instantly generates the web page with the transcript and  links to the sound file. Some people are amazing that we are able to drive so much content to the web with such a small staff. Livecode is the key to getting work done and doesn't cost me painful hours and weeks of coding that other languages or environments would require. Mac desktop, local network, unix shell, globally distributed apps to staff who use both Mac and Windows, all working seamlessly with our linux web server (which also uses Livecode for our main site) &mdash; all done with a single application base.  It's mind boggling if you think about it. </p>



<h2>Grapple - Version Control for InDesign</h2>
<img src="/html/info/livecode-in-action/grapple-version-control.jpg" alt="grapple-version-control"  class="float-left" />
<p>At Himalayan Academy Publications as many as ten different editors may need to read and write files for our books and international magazine. We use Adobe's Indesign for our graphical publications. Years ago we used Adobe's Version cue which was both expensive, buggy and kept causing use grief. On top of that they decided to "end of life" that application and we soon to be left with no version control system. I wanted to create a fool proof app that anyone with no training could use, which was required virtually no maintenance, and which did not have all the unnecessary bells and whistles that our editors complained they never used and only made life complicated. Using a LiveCode ability to leverage the shell and it fabulous file management tools I created a lean revision control system that simply copies and renames files from the main server on our network to the local version control folders. In two years since we I set this up we have never had a single file corruption or loss of data and the over head in management is virtually zero. Livecode makes this possible.
