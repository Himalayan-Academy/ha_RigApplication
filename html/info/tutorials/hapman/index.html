<h1>HAPMan Tutorial for Editing and Adding Audio Records in the Jnanam Database</h1>

<p>Our code name for the the database on our web server that contains data for the www.himalayanacademy.com web site is "Jnanam." In general discussion we may also just say "the data base."<p>

<p>Jnanam contains records of several types. For our present purposes we are interested in the records that contain metadata pertaining to media. There is one record for each media artifact/file(s) of the following media types: audio, art, photos, slideshows, video, apps and publications. These types are further subdivided (e.g. audio/inspired talks; audio/songs; audio/chants etc). There are other tables and records for web pages and collections which we will ignore for now. For this tutorial are interested in the "media records."</p>

<p>In HAPMAN we can see the data for the different media types. For "novice" non-nerd sevaks who are helping, please be aware that these records are do not affect the audio files themselves, and the database does not itself contain any audio, slideshow or video etc. As such there is not really much you can do wrong or break. If you make an error in a record, it is easily fixed and nothing "bad" will happen. The only "bad" thing you could do would be to give out your log in details which you must never do.<p>

<p>We have a single toggle button that determines if a piece of media will show up in search and be available to the public. You will see this as "Approved" which will either be set to "Yes" or "No". If for any reason you feel the media, or it's metadata, is not ready for prime time, then you can change this to "No" and enter some production notes to clarify the issues to be resolved before it can go live. In general, anything we enter can be set to "Yes". At least in the case of audio, it is not really a matter of waiting for approval. Any song uploaded by a sevak (who obviously is already trusted to use HAPMAN and in close touch with the Aadheenam) can be considered "Approved-YES". </p>

<p>The reverse of this is: if you find something wrong in a piece of media, then you can set the "Approved" to "NO" yourself; and put some notes in the production notes field and send Brahmanathswami an email about it. Please always site either item_id (a number) or the file_ID (a unique string of characters, that normally, but not always, matches the title. Note that HAPMAN is a work in progress and has a few rough edges, but mostly it works very well.</p>
