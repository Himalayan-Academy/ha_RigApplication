 <h1> <a name="redirect"> Redirect Framework</a> </h1>
       
<p>Current plan is to adopt the same method currently used at HA.com<p>
<ul>
<li> Script handles incoming URI, dealing with minute cases first, followed by more general cases</li>
<li> If no matches, then default to the redirect matrix array map</li>
<li> if above fails, then  send custom 404, link to web master and log the 404 separate.</li>
<li> idea: create a separate long for image 404's  as these are leeches hot linking to our site which is forbidden. It would be interesting to see who does this.</li>
</ul> 
       
 <p>      Hi Brahmanathaswami,
<br />
it is the Exceptions.lc library in system/libraries.
In this library search for "rigShow404Page".
This handler is called by the rigShow404 command in
system/revigniter/Common.lc.
<br />

Best
<br />
Ralf

 <h1> <a name="devsite">New Development Server --> Production Server Methods</a> </h1>
 
 <p> Our plan now is to keep dev.himalayanacademy.com for development purposes. Andre wants us to start following a procedure where all changes are made on the dev site and rSynced to the production site. For this to work we need to have some agreements, conventions and technology in place. Some of this has to be sorted out. Issues and requirements that we can see for now are:</p>
 
<ul>
	<li>Until rsync is set up we would need to make edits on dev.himalayanacademy.com and then copy those files to the production server or vice-versa.</li>
	<li> What about the enyo Editor? anyone using this will be touching files live on the production server. I am already using this intensively as for small changes it is very efficient (we need to make the editing are bigger)</li>
	<li> What if two areas of the dev site are "under construction" for example, senthilnathaswami might be be testing some CSS in the /blog/wp-content/themes/taka  directory and working on this over a period of a few days and it's not ready to go live.  But, meanwhile someone else edits to a three pages and Andre finishes some web app on the dev site. How does the sync process know what to push to production and what is not ready?</li>
</ul>
