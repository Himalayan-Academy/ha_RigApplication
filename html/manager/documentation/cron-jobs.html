					<li> Rename Jnanam Database</li>
					<li> /home/devhap/cgi-bin/rename-database.cgi</li>
					<li> Runs daily at Midnite</li>
					<li> Set as cron job via VirtualMin control panel -->Web Min-->System-->Scheduled Cron jobs</li>
					<li> We set up VirtualMin to back up the Jnanam database daily but each night at midnight it over write the previous one. This script renames that file at mid-night, thereby preserving each night's back up as a separate file. We need to change path to the command in the cron tab to /home/himalayan/... after we go live.</li>
