<h1> notes from landing pages for consideration in further development. </h1> 

<h2>quick links for chants and songs</h2> 
<p>Podcasts(Note: This plain page should introduce each podcast and give access to links for people to subscribe in iTunes, plain RSS subscription links for another reader/subscriber app of their choice, and an interface to (at least) the latest episodes in the pocast)</p>
<p>Home Puja Audio(Note: This plain page should introduce the home puja training and then include links to the PDF and audio files of the Ganesha puja. If it is just one audio file, then we don't need a media catalog page. If it is more than one, we may need to link to a Media Catalog page with search results or however we are going to do that.)</p> 
<p>Sacred Aums(Note: In the new system, it makes sense for this to just be a category of individual media artifacts that can be displayed as thumbnails in our Media Catalog template and then people can click to go to a Media Artifact page to see a larger version of a particular Aum and download it in whatever various formats we provide them in. I don't think we should preserve the old pages, though sub-categorization work may help. We may want to conceive of a way for a Media Catalog page to display a list of thumbnails that are distinct categories, clicking on which will open up a Media Catalog page of the items within that category.)</p>
