<h1>Himalayan Academy Web Site Manager Desktop Application</h1>
<h2> Namaste, Vanakkam and Aloha:</h2>

    <p>For those who are helping (or will be helping) with content additions and editing on our new web site we have a new version of the Himalayan Academy Web Site Manager Loader. 
    
    <p>This is the first official release 1.0 of the loader, which in turn downloads the HAP Manager, 1.5.</p>

    <p><b>Disclaimer</b>: Not all elements on the interface of all media types are fully functional. We are developing these as we move forward, based on our migration priorities. The audio section is quite complete as it is and has been used by several sevaks. But, for example, there is no Preview function for slideshows (and we may implement this in a different manner.)</p>

    <p>Feel free to use the "Leave Feedback" option and ask any questions or make any observations at any time. Your feedback is helpful.</p>

    <p>Since this application communicates across the internet to the web server in San Franscisco, you must be connected to the internet for it to run. Since all operations require a remote communication to California, it may take a moment for screens to fill up with data. Be patient. If your internet connection is slow it may feel "sluggish"</p>

    <p>In addition, we cannot possibly anticipate all the various connectivity issues or problems. Unlike an application that runs on your desktop where the environment is stable, internet connections are constantly changing. If the application "locks up" or stops for any reason... don't worry, nothing is broken, just force quit and start again.</p>

    <h2>Installation Instructions:</h2>
    <p><b>Mac Users:</b></p>

    <p>Simply download and unzip the application and place it in your applications folder. It has a proper icon so you could put this in your Dock for easy recognition.</p>

    <p><b>Windows Users:</b></p>

  <p><a href="http://www.himalayanacademy.com/stacks/HapManager-Windows.zip">http://www.himalayanacademy.com/stacks/HapManager-Windows.zip</a></p>

    <p>You will need to extract the entire zip archive as a single folder. Do not allow your system to unzip only parts of the file. Depending on your system you should have the option to "extract/expand entire file" be sure to choose that option.</p>

    <p>You should get folder named</p>

    <p>HapSiteManagerLoader (with these files/folders inside:) </p>
<ul>
	<li>revsecurity.dll</li>
	<li>    HAPSiteManagerLoader.exe </li>
	<li>    Externals (this is another folder)</li>
</ul>


    <p>Be sure all these are together in the same folder.</p>

    <p>Then you can double click the "HAPSiteManagerLoader.exe" to make it run. You can put the entire folder into your programs folder and then make a shortcut for the HAPSiteManagerLoader.exe on your desktop.</p>

    <h2>USAGE:</h2>

    <p>1) The HAP Manager loader dynamically downloads the actual working parts of the application from the cloud (our server in San Franscisco) each time it runs. so when you start up, wait a moment while the loader fetches the main applications and opens it. You will be asked for your user name (your email address) and your password. If you forgot your password contact me. We are not planning and will never be implementing any kind or user initiated registration or change of password option. The security issues are too high; you must contact the Aadheenam admin to be authenticated for usage. you can click "remember me" and your log in details will be saved and presented to you automatically next time you open the application.</p>

    <p>2) The main screen, left hand column offers the list of media types that you are authorized to see and access.</p>

    <p>3) click on the media type, for example "Audio" or "Slideshows" or "Pages" to get a list of all the media records of that type on the web server... then you double click to enter and edit a record.</p>

    <p>4) the lists can be quite long, use the filter field ("search") at the top right. Enter a term or a name and the list will be reduced to only the records you want to look at. Example, if you are in Audio and you know you want to add lyrics to a bhajan for Ganesha, just type "bhajan" or "ganesha". You can resize the columns if you wish</p>

    <p>7) <b>Editing records</b> is quite straight forward -- just change or add information to fields and click "save"</p>

    <p>7) if the type is too small, use the type resizer in the top left. This works globally so all fields will be increased...This is useful for pages and lyrics but some fields are small, and you may need to reduce the size again to have the data fit and appear fully.</p>

    <p>8) Under the left in the listing page you see four options below under "SYSTEM"</p>

    <p><b>Information</b>: this is not yet implemented Network Reset: Not Yet Implemented Leave Feedback: You can use this to send us an email with an observation, bug report or feature request. Log Out: Logs you out.</p>

   <h2>Adding New Content</h2>

    <p>Adding new content will take some training. Each media type has a slightly different scenario. If you are authorized to add new content for any particular media type, contact Sivakatirswami for instructions.</p>

    <p>In the future we will prepare tutorials and movies</p>

    <p>Thank you for helping with our web site!</p>

    <p>Om Shanti<br />
