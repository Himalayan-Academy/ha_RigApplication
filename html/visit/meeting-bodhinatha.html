	It is appropriate for members of the Hindu faith to request darshan with the Satguru who heads the monastery. With prior arrangement, Satguru Bodhinatha Veylanswami will meet Hindu guests after the morning puja (starting around 10:30), if he is home. If you are coming to Kauai and wish to have darshan with Satguru, please <a href="mailto:saravana@hindu.org?subject=Darshan%20with%20Satguru%20Bodhinatha">
		write to us in advance</a> and also tell a bit about yourself. <a href="/visit/meet-us-when-we-travel">Check his schedule</a> to be sure he is home on the dates of your visit here. He also suggests that visitors prepare questions in advance to bring to the meeting for a fruitful discussion. Children are welcome.
