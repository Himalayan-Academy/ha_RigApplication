<p>The front area of the monastery up to the private temple entry wall and gate leading to Kadavul Hindu Temple is open from 9:00 AM - noon. All are welcome to meditate under the awesome banyan tree, explore the large information panels. in the Banyan Mandapam. which tell about our monastery and the Hindu religion and browse through the many publications and Hindu religious supplies in our Mini-Mela visitor center. Always plan to come in the morning.</p>

<p>Unlike most Hindu temples which are public, Kadavul Hindu Temple and the monastery grounds surrounding it are private, due to their presence within a traditional Saivite aadheenam or monastery/temple complex. To protect the sanctity of the temple ceremony, only those visitors who wish to worship at the traditional 9:00 AM temple ceremony (Siva puja) are welcome to enter the inner gate leading to the temple before 10:30 AM. Visitors who do not wish to participate in the worship are welcome to enter this area from 10:30 AM - noon.</p>
