		</h3>
		Kauai's Hindu Monastery is a sacred place of pilgrimage for all Hindus seeking peace and divine experience. Here are some basic guidelines to help you plan your visit.<br />
		<br />
		<h3 class="h3">
			When to visit?
		</h3>
		The front monastery area, including Kadavul Hindu Temple, is open daily from 9am to noon.<br />
		<br />
		A self-guided tour is available for this area. You are welcome to download the PDF map of this tour <a href="http://www.himalayanacademy.com/ssc/hawaii/images/kauai_hindu_monastery_map.pdf">click here, (file size 575kb)</a> or pick up the map and accompanying booklet when you arrive at our entrance. The tour will give you a basic introduction to the monastery and its areas of service.<br />
		<br />
		Hindus are encouraged to attend the 9am Siva puja in Kadavul Temple. It lasts about 1.5 hours. Hindus wanting an archana performed for them in Kadavul Temple must write clearly in English, on a piece of paper, their name, nakshatra and gotra (if known). Hand this piece of paper to the monastic in the temple at 9am before the puja commences. While there is no fee for an archana, donations are welcome.<br />
		<br />
		After the puja, if Hindu guests wish to see the under-construction Iraivan Temple, a local devotee may be available to show you out, or you can request a self-guided tour map from the priest. This additional area is accessible before or after our <b>monastic retreat days</b>.<br />
		<br />
		<h3 class="h3">
			Monastic Retreat Days
		</h3>
		Please note that our monastery follows the traditional lunar calendar, <a href="http://www.himalayanacademy.com/resources/panchangam/" target="_blank">panchangam</a>. The table below shows dates when the offices and some parts of the monastery grounds including Iraivan Temple are closed (the monastery's Kadavul Hindu Temple remains open every day). These days are known as "monastic retreat days," or days off for the monks. Hindus should plan their visit around these monastic retreat days, as Bodhinatha and the monks are not available to meet with guests on these days. However, Kadavul Hindu Temple always remains open for worship and meditation between 9am and noon, with the daily Siva puja beginning at 9am and the final arati about 10am.<br />

			Detailed Guided Tour
		</h3>
		Approximately once a week, a guided tour begins at 9am in the gazebo at the monastery entrance, 107 Kaholalele Road. It lasts about 90 minutes. The tour is free, however love offerings are welcomed, as donations from visitors are what allows us to continue building Iraivan Temple and beautify this sanctuary. Parking is very limited, therefore reservations are required. Please call toll free 1-888-735-1619 to find out upcoming tour dates and reserve your parking space. Reservations are not required if you arrive by taxi and the taxi does not stay.<br />
		<br />
		Highlights of the walking tour include:<br />
		- introduction to the monastery and Hinduism<br />
		- the 353-acre spiritual sanctuary with its botanical gardens, waterways and ponds<br />
		- watch the stone craftsmen, silpis, from India carve and assemble the granite Iraivan Temple--a noble icon of Hinduism's beauty and greatness<br />
		- the awesome monolithic 20,000 pound, 12-foot-tall black granite statue of God Siva as Dakshinamurthi<br />
		- Kadavul Hindu Temple with its central sanctum housing an exquisite, 6-foot-tall bronze statue of God Siva as Nataraja, Lord of the Dance. The temple also houses Iraivan Temple's future 700-pound, 39-inch-tall quartz crystal Sivalingam deity.<br />
