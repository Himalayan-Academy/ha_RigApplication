<h3 class="h3">Directions to Kauai's Hindu Monastery</h3>


<p>The monastery address is 107 Kaholalele RD Kapaa, Hawaii, 96746. To get to the monastery, driving north from the LIHUE airport (LIH) on Kuhio Highway toward Kapaa town, watch for the lights just after the bridge over the Wailua River. Before the lights, get in the left lane; turn left, inland, at the lights onto Kuamo'o Road (between Coco Palms Hotel and the Wailua River). Continue up the hill, for just over 4 miles. One-quarter mile past the 4-mile marker, just after driving up a steep curve,  turn left at the second cross street, Kaholalele Road, and go one block to the end of the road on the right side where you'll see 107 address number. If you do not turn left onto Kaholalele RD you may end up at the Rudraksha grove. If you do, turn around and return to Kaholalele RD and take a right.</p>

<p>Staying to the right of our neighbors' large red and white sign, proceed down Temple Lane and park according to the indicator signs, and enter the little open pavilion to start your visit. You can find our phone number in the island phone book, under "Churches/Hindu, Saiva Siddhanta Church. Travel Tip: Sit on the left side of the plane next to a window to get a clear view of Kauai.</p>
