	Elaboration on the above events 
</h3>
<p>
	- The simple Siva homa lasts about one hour (preliminary pujas are performed before you arrive). Afterwards, Satguru Bodhinatha Veylanswami gives a discourse for about 20 minutes. In his absence one of the senior monastics will speak. Please bring a flashlight because the parking area and entrance path is dark at that time. Also, during the winter months it will be cool and the temple doors are kept open, so bring a covering to keep warm if necessary.<br />
	- The Ardra Nataraja Abhishekam takes place once a month for the main deity of Kadavul Temple, the 6-foot tall Nataraja. You may bring offerings of milk, yogurt, fruits or flowers for the abhishekam and puja.<br />
	- The Chitra Gurudeva pada puja takes place about once a month. An abhishekam and puja is performed to Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami's tiruvadi (paduka) in Kadavul Temple. 
</p>
<h3 class="h3">
	Archanas 
</h3>
<p>
	Hindus wanting an archana performed for them in Kadavul Temple must write clearly in English, on a piece of paper, their name, nakshatra and gotra (if known). Hand this piece of paper to the monastic in the temple at 9am before the puja commences. While there is no fee for an archana, donations are welcome. 
</p>
<h3 class="h3">
	Offering Prayers 
</h3>
<p>
	When Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami founded Kadavul Temple, he said the Deity, Lord Nataraja, had brought us a special boon. It was that written prayers burned in the temple’s perpetual sacred fire are received in the Antarloka, or astral world, where they can be read by the unseen devas who serve in the temple. The devas then do their best to help the devotee, within the constraints of the karmic situation. Please write clearly with black ink (or type) on white paper, then place your prayer in the prayer basket in the temple. Prayers are considered strictly confidential and are never read prior to burning. At an auspicious time the monastic will burn your prayer in the temple's sacred fire. To learn more about this practice, see Gurudeva’s explanation in <i>Living with Siva</i> by <a href="/book/living-with-siva/207">clicking here</a>.

<h3 class="h3">
	Darshan with Satguru Bodhinatha Veylanswami 
</h3>
<p>
	Hindus wishing to have darshan with Bodhinatha should plan their visit around his travels, and also take note that when he is on the island, he is not necessarily available every day. So, be sure to <a href="mailto:saravana@hindu.org?subject=Pilgrimage%20to%20Kauai's%20Hindu%20Monastery">e-mail</a> ahead of time to arrange a possible meeting. For the current status of his travels, please visit Bodhinatha's <a href="/taka/guru_travels.html" target="_blank">travel page</a>. Those who have arranged a darshan with Bodhinatha should come to the meeting with one or more questions in mind to ask him.
