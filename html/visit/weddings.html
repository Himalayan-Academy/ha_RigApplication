<p>As we are a cloistered monastery for monastics, we do not participate in or have weddings on the property. However, many couples do come here for blessings in Kadavul Hindu Temple after they are married elsewhere. In the State of Hawaii there are no priests specializing in Hindu weddings. A number of couples have brought a priest of their tradition who conducts the wedding ceremony at another location on the island. And then the wedding party will come for blessings in our temple, and sometimes additional blessings through meeting Satguru Bodhinatha Veylanswami. Below we provide some contact information to help with planning your wedding.</p>
