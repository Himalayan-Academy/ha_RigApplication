	When to visit?
</h3>

<p>
	The front monastery area, including Kadavul temple, is open daily from 9am to noon. Please come early. No additional time frame is open except to Hindus on pilgrimage who have made advance arrangements as described further below.</p>
<p>
	Hindus may attend the daily 9am Siva puja in Kadavul temple. It lasts about 1.5 hours. After the puja, you may view part of the under-construction Iraivan Temple through a nearby telescope.  
</p>
<p>
	Members of the Hindu religion who wish for more than a one-day visit may <a href="mailto:saravana@hindu.org?subject=Pilgrimage%20request">
		contact us in advance</a> to officially arrange their stay as pilgrims with special access to perform sadhanas at various times on the grounds on multiple days. Being on pilgrimage means visiting the monastery and temple for more than one morning, and grants access to occasional special pujas.

		<h3 class="h1">Monastic Retreat Days</h3>
		
		<p>Please note that our monastery follows the traditional lunar calendar, panchangam. The dates listed below are known as "monastic retreat days," or days off. Hindus on pre-arranged pilgrimages should expected less access to sadhana activities on these monastic retreat days. Satguru Bodhinatha Veylanswami and the monks are generally not available to meet with guests on these days.</p>
		<p>These retreat days are good ones for pilgrims to use to schedule their Kauai outings -- Napali Coast boat tours, trips to Waimea Canyon, beach day with the family, etc.
