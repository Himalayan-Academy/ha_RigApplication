<p>If you are coming to Kauai on a cruise ship and would like to visit the monastery and temple, the following information will be helpful. </p>

<h3 class="h3">Daily Timing</h3>
<ul>
	<li>There are two temples at our monastery, the small Siva Nataraja temple called Kadavul Temple and the new, all stone Iraivan Temple which is still under construction.</li>
	<li>Kadavul Siva Temple is open daily between 9am and 12 noon for puja worship, and after 10:30am for exploring.</li>
<li>During its construction, Iraivan temple is open to visitors who have made reservations for a guided tour, which starts sharp at 9am. See our <a href="/visit/come-on-a-tour">Public Tour page for details.</a></li>
	<li>The monastery is closed after noon and all afternoon to tourist visitors.</li>
	<li>So make sure you plan to visit us first! Do your shopping and local sight-seeing after you come the temple. Remember: 9am to 12pm each morning.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="h3">Travel and Visit Time Guideline</h3>
<ul>
	<li>You should plan for at least 1/2 hour travel to the monastery and 1/2 to get back to the boat if you are going by taxi. If you are renting a car, you will need to add time for pick up and return.</li>
	<li>It will be best to have at least 1 hour here. Therefore you should allow at least 2 1/2 hours if the temple is your only stop. If the boat departs late in the afternoon, come to the temple first and do your sight-seeing second.</li>
	
</ul>

<h3 class="h3">Transportation Options</h3>
<ul>
	<li><b>Car Rental: </b> Car rentals are done near the airport, which is a 10-minute drive from the dock. This is your least expensive option. The car rental companies have shuttles that you can take from the dokc to pick up your car. </li>
	<li><b>Taxi:</b> You may hire a taxi bring you to the monastery and then call a taxi, or arrange for one to return and take you back to the boat at a pre-arranged time. This can be a good option if you plan to be here all morning (arriving at 9 am and staying until 12 noon) Taxis charge about $40.00 each way. </li>
	<li><b>Hire a driver:</b> Most cab companies offer a rates for longer periods, e.g. 4-8 hours at about $60.00 an hour. If you can afford this, it is a convenient way to first come to the temple, have the driver wait, then have him take you sight-seeing and shopping. The drivers are very familiar with the area.</li>
	<li><b>Kauai Bus Services:</b> Kauai's bus service does not come to the temple. But it may be an inexpensive option for visiting other places on the public bus route.</li>
