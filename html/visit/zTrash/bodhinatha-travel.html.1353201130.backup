<h1>
	Bodhinatha's Upcoming Travels 
</h1>
<p>
	It is appropriate for members of the Hindu faith to request darshan with the Satguru who heads the monastery. Bodhinatha will normally meet Hindu guests after the morning puja, if he is home. But pilgrims need to make a specific request to see him. If you are coming to Kauai and wish to have darshan or speak with Bodhinatha, please make your request to our hosts. Check his schedule here to be sure he is home on the dates of your pilgrimage here. He also suggests that pilgrims prepare questions in advance to bring to the meeting for a fruitful discussion. Children are welcome.
</p>
<p>
	If you would like to have darshan with Satguru Bodhinatha Veylanswami when he visits your area or assist with logistics during his upcoming travels, please
