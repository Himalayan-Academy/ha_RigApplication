 <h1>Kauai Dining Guide for Vegetarians</h1>
 
    <div id="mainContentSection">
     <!--  TEXT_COLUMN start -->
<p>This list of dining options on Kauai is to help Hindu pilgrims keep a pure vegetarian diet. Restaurants range from pure vegan and vegetarian where no meat, fish or eggs are ever used in the kitchen at any time, to those that offer excellent vegetarian fare along side a regular "steak and lobster" menu. Others do not cater specifically to vegetarians at all, but serve a wide range of fresh vegy options. Last on the list are "limited vegy options," These restaurants have excellent views and facilities, but be prepared to work with your waiter to design your meal. Listings are sorted by level of offerings and proximity  to the temple.</p>

<p><b>Description: </b>Fruit stands have sprouted on this island, and smoothies are gaining ground as the milkshake of the new millennium. New crops of exotic trees imported from Southeast Asia are maturing on Kauai, creating anticipation among residents and fruitful ideas for the smoothie world. "Everyone's waiting for the mangosteens and durians," comments Joe Halasey who, with his wife, Cynthia, runs Banana Joe's , the granddaddy of Kauai's roadside fruit-and-smoothie stands.  Banana Joe's has been a Kilauea landmark since it opened in 1986.  Sapodilla, star apple (round, purple, and sweet, like a creamy Concord grape), macadamia nuts, Anahola Granola, and homemade breads -- like banana and mango-coconut -- are among Banana Joe's attractions. The Halaseys have expanded their selection of organic vegetables and exude a quiet aloha from their roadside oasis.

</blockquote>
<p><b>Description: </b>Pizzas $11-$26	
The much-loved bakery puts out guava sourdough; Hanalei poi sourdough; fresh chive, goat-cheese, and sun-dried-tomato bread; blackberry-white chocolate scones; and other fine baked goods. The breads go well with the soups and hot lunch specials, and the pastries with the new full-service espresso bar, which serves not only the best of the bean, but also blended frozen drinks and such up-to-the-minute voguish things as iced chai and Mexican chocolate smoothies (with cinnamon). We also love the fresh vegetables in olive oil and herbs, baked in a baguette; the olive tapenade; and the classic scampi pizza with tiger prawns, roasted garlic, capers, and cheeses. The Picketts have added a small dining room, and the few outdoor picnic tables under umbrellas are as inviting as ever. The macadamia nut butter cookies and lilikoi-fruit Danishes are sublime.</p>

<p><b>Description: </b>Main courses 13$-26$   The charming plantation-style building that used to be the Hanalei Museum is now Hanalei's gourmet central. Postcards is known for its use of healthful ingredients, island-fresh and creatively prepared and presented (like fresh fish, grilled or blackened, with macadamia-nut butter, honey Dijon, or peppered-pineapple sage), and for its imaginative use of local ingredients (as in taro fritters served with papaya salsa). Other choices include Thai summer rolls, sautÂed prawns, nori rolls (filled with rice, vegetables, and tempeh), and ever-popular seafood specials. In the front yard, an immense, mossy, hollowed-out stone serves as a free-standing lily pond and roadside landmark. Great menu, presentation, and ambience -- a winner.</p>
