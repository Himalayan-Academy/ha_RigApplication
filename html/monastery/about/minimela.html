	You won't want to miss our Mini Mela Library and Visitor Center. Located just off the path leading to Kadavul Temple, it is open on most days between 9am and noon.  The Mini Mela displays Gurudeva's books, as well as carefully-selected books by other authors, such as vegetarian cookbooks, ayurveda, health and children's books and texts on nonviolent child-rearing. We have a large selection of Hindu Deities of various sizes in granite, semiprecious stone and brass, all imported from India. The rudraksha prayer beads grown in our own forest and prepared by temple devotees are a favorite with visitors. There are also altar supplies, crystals, greeting cards, quality incense, posters, jewelry, music CDs, DVDs and more.
