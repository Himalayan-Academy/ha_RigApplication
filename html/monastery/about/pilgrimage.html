 "Our family returned home with such clarity of faith in Hindu Dharma. Our children cant stop talking about the visit. Now they are proud to be Hindus. I finally understood so many things, renewed my spirit and uncovered a new vision for my future. It is such a place of peace and beautyno one could believe it without seeing for themselves. All the troubles in my mind just dissolved. It is amazing to see Hindu monks in the middle of the Pacific uplifting global Hinduism through information technology and publications. These are testimonies from families who have made prearranged special pilgrimages to the monastery, a practice that many perform yearly for worship, sadhana (spiritual disciplines) and retreat from day-to-day concerns. Hindus may e-mail iraivan@hindu.org in advance to arrange their visit. In the weeks before their journey, they perform additional study and disciplines, and on the flight to Hawaii they remain focused on the lofty intent of their journey. Such serious seekers prepare well in advance to reap the life-changing benefits of this pristine sanctuary. Among the best times to plan a pilgrimage are Mahasivaratri (February-March), Guru Purnima (July) and Gurudevas mahasamadhi observances (October-November). These three auspicious times are especially powerful for worship and meditation and for enjoying the fellowship of like-minded devotees. Many choose a special occasion for their pilgrimage, such as a wedding anniversary, birthday or new beginning in life, and seek special blessings at our weekly 6am fire ceremony. Young people love mornings at the temple and afternoons at the beach. There are several sadhanas that pilgrims can perform at the monastery, including meditating on the banks of the Wailua River, walking the straight path to God, attending the morning puja at the Swayambhu Lingam, performing abhishekam to the Narmada Lingam on the Path of the Saivite Saints, meditating atop Muruga Hill, wandering through the sanctuary, <a href="/livespiritually/become-student">studying The Master Course</a> and attending puja in Kadavul Temple. Pilgrimage ends with a personal darshan meeting with Bodhinatha on the last day of the stay, if he is in residence. <a href="/visit/come-on-a-pilgrimage">More about pilgrimage...</a>
