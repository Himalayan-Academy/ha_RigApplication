Though remote, Kauais Hindu Monastery is a spiritual lighthouse for tens of thousands of people around the worldseekers of varying commitments and interests, Hindus of all denominations, members of other faiths and those of no formal faith at all. Uncounted numbers find solace and guidance in Gurudevas teachings, in print and through our website. Hindu families make regular annual visits that start out as vacation pilgrimage and soon become pilgrimage vacations. Even casual guests who have visited just once hold the monastery in their heart for the rest of their life, harkening back to its placid and untroubled energies when things get rocky back home. During Bodhinathas frequent travels, devotees at temples across North America, Australia, New Zealand and Southeast Asia come for his darshan, forming an initial tie with this ancient guru lineage. Dozens of such temples around the world rely on the monastery for strength and guidance. Through daily worship, meditation and study of The Master Course, the most ardent seekers become initiated devotees of Bodhinatha and members of his Saiva Siddhanta Church. It is this core group, made strong by their daily disciplines and their formal pledge of loyalty, which sustains the presence of the Church around the world. Church members tithe to support the monastery and its good works, and give generously of their time. Their shared strengths, bolstered by regular religious gatherings with other members in their area, uplift families and keep them firmly on the path. Such groups are most numerous in the US, Malaysia and in Mauritius. In that island nation, we have a seven-acre parcel of land dedicated as a <a href="/ssc/mauritius/">Spiritual Park</a>, where hundreds of Hindus convene each month for worship and spiritual fellowship and thousands celebrate Ganesha Chaturthi. We have a small group of formal members here on Kauai who live near the monastery and spend their spare hours helping with monastery activities, such as hosting visitors and arranging festivals. <a href="/ssc/">More about Saiva Siddhanta Church...</a>
