Gazing across the valley of the Wailua River and its Nani Kaua Pond, you see the gold-leafed domes of Indian design shimmering in the sunlight, with majestic Mount Waialeale in the background. You are beholding the towers of Iraivan Temple, a pure and powerful white granite wonderment carved in India entirely by hand and erected ten thousand miles away on this Garden Island by Indian master stone masons. Tens of thousands of pilgrims have stood in this same spot, marvelling at the miracle before them. This is the crown jewel of Kauais Hindu Monastery, being constructed, first and foremost, as a destination for devotees on annual pilgrimage. Now is a highly auspicious time to be here, for the temple is actually being created in your presence. As you tread the garden paths leading to the temple, you may hear the steady chip, chip, chip of hammers and chisels in the hands of resident artisans from India, fitting one of the 3,000 blocks of stone, erecting an edifice according to ancient Agamic mystical injunctions to connect the Divine and the material, the spirit and the body, Heaven and Earth. Stand in awe before this monument of sacred art and ancient architecture, designed to stand for ten centuries and more. Walk round the sanctum. Send blessings to your loved ones. Touch the pillars. Here, every detail, every sacred, crystal-rich particle of granite conspires to bring you closer to God within. Hindus revere a sanctified edifice like Iraivan not only as a temple, but as the very body of God. Iraivan is an ancient Tamil word for God meaning, He who is worshiped. This temple was inspired by a series of mystical visions of Siva that came to Gurudeva early in the morning on February 15, 1975, in which he saw Lord Siva seated on a large boulder that was later discovered on the then overgrown property. These visions inspired him to begin this exquisite temple, unlike any in the world. Since that day, pujas have been held daily at the spot, which will one day be sheltered within an elegant, open-air pavilion.  <a href="/monastery/temples/iraivan/">More about Iraivan...</a>
