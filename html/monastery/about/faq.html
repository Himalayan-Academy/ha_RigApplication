<p>
Every visitor asks this important question. We are not sure when Iraivan temple will be completed, as it depends on availability of craftsmen in India and the rate of donations. Following Gurudeva's vision and instructions, we are determined to create a spiritual gem to amaze and inspire the world. We are not in a hurry. A masterpiece like this cannot be rushed.
</p>
<h6 class="h6">
	Do you have overnight facilities for visitors? 
</h6>
<p>
	No, we don't, but visitors will find accommodations at nearby bed & breakfast facilities and seaside hotels. 
</p>
<h6 class="h6">
	Can I participate in the ashram's activities? 
</h6>
<p>
	It's important to understand that this a monastery and not a modern style American ashram, where any and all devotees, including marriad couples, can take up residence. Only initiated monks and premonastics in training live here. As such, activities are restricted to resident monastics, members, students and those on formal pilgrimage. 
</p>
<h6 class="h6">
	What do the various colored robes mean? 
</h6>
<p>
	Those dressed in orange are swamis under lifetime vows, ordained after a training period of eight to twelve years. Those in the latter half of that training wear yellow and are called yogis. Monks in white are sadhakas, who take vows two years at a time. All the sadhakas wear khaki outfits when working on the grounds, swamis are in orange/red. 
</p>
<h6 class="h6">
	Why do the monks wear three white stripes and a red dot on their forehead? 
</h6>
<p>
	These are the traditional sectarian marks of Saivite Hinduism. The three stripes, made with sacred ash, represent the three bonds of the soul--ego, karma and maya--which are destroyed by God's grace. The dot represents the third eye of spiritual insight. 
</p>
<h6 class="h6">
	Do the monks have jobs in the world? 
</h6>

</p>
<h6 class="h6">

</p>
<h6 class="h6">
