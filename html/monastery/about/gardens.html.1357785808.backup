Though it is traditional for Hindu temples to cultivate <a href="/ssc/hawaii/photo-gallery/gardens.shtml">beautiful garden grounds</a>, resplendent with flowers to be offered in holy ceremony, as well as fruits and even medicinal resources, Kauais Hindu Monastery has far exceeded all such aspirations. Over the past 20 years, this oasis four miles from the sea has been transformed from an overgrown jungle to a tropical paradise. It all started with Gurudevas 1975 vision of Lord Siva blessing pilgrims amid beautiful groves and gardens. As the monastery grew, so did the monks desire to manifest that vision. As the construction of Iraivan Temple progresses, the surrounding groves, gardens and ponds are simultaneously achieving their own maturity, with hundreds of blossoming trees, exotic tropical flowers exploding with color and exotic bamboos soaring to 80 feet and more. Here, pilgrims may sit and meditate by the 180-foot-wide natural rock river pond or wander through discrete mini-environments: the Path of the Tamil Saivite Saints, the Straight Path to God, Rishi Valley, Bali Hai Falls and the Wests only Rudraksha Forest, to name a few. Here one finds scented plumeria, konrai groves, fields of hybiscus, fruit orchids, fields of mondo grass, coco palms, tree ferns, breadfruit, taro, fragrant vines, luscious lilikoi, rare native species, mosses and ferns, waterfalls, massive banyans 300 feet across, redwood pavilions and lava rock gardens. Sacred and ayurvedic plants from India and Sri Lankabilva, neem, amala, curry leaf, rudraksha, betel, champaka and areca nuthave been methodically collected, along with important specimens from our culture, such as palmyra, sandalwood, durian, mangosteen, chiku, lichee, mango, plantain and jackfruit. The Narmada Stream meanders through the monastery, creating beautiful ponds, falls and secluded marshes, providing refuge for wild birds and a playground for pastel water lilies and sacred lotuses. Tropical flowers here include 300 varieties of heliconia and ginger, a rare treasury of 250 kinds of ti plants, hundreds of exotic palms, a copious collection of aroids and bromeliads and even, in the worlds wettest spot, an arid garden with cacti, agaves and desert succulents. <a href="/monastery/tour">More about the sacred gardens...</a>
