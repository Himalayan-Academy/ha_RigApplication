Here at the monastery, you will find that the monks share a positive, buoyant spirit about life. The reason for that is found in the wealth of wisdom in the insightful teachings they live by--the treasury of Hindu scriptures, particularly the works of our own Gurudeva. A brilliant teacher and orator, he spoke eloquently about virtually every aspect of life--from ultimate reality to household harmony, kundalini yoga to adolescent angst. In his latter years, he and his monastic publishing team assembled the essence of his fifty years of ministry in the three large volumes of The Master Course. <a href="/view/dancing-with-siva">Dancing with Siva</a> is a contemporary catechism, outlining in question-and-answer form the basics of Saivite Hinduism. In <a href="/view/living-with-siva">Living with Siva</a> Gurudeva focuses on how to live a truly spiritual life, sharing insights on how to approach family, money, relationships, technology, food, worship, yoga, karma and more. <a href="/view/merging-with-siva">Merging with Siva</a> consists of 52 of Gurudeva's inspired talks on raja yoga, God Realization, the clear white light, the states of mind, dreams, the nature of thought, the chakras, auras, death and dying, the guru-disciple relationship and more. In addition, we have <a href="/view/how-to-become-a-hindu">How to Become a Hindu</a>, a guide for seekers wishing to enter this venerable faith; <a href="/resources/books/weaver/">Weaver's Wisdom</a>, a translation of the South Indian ethical masterpiece, Tirukural; and <a href="/view/loving-ganesha">Loving Ganesha</a>, a charming text dedicated to the benevolent Lord of Obstacles worshiped by all Hindus. Yoga's Forgotten Foundation presents and discusses Hinduism's code of conduct, the yamas and niyamas, as a necessary prerequisite to the practice of yoga. <a href="/view/lemurian-scrolls">Lemurian Scrolls</a> explores the rare topics of Hindu monastic life and the origins of humanity. Our most recent book, What Is Hinduism?, is a 416-page, photo-rich book drawn from Hinduism Today that presents the many facets of the family of faiths called Hinduism in a comprehensive and contemporary way while authoritatively answering the questions everyone asks about our complex faith. <a href="/readlearn">More about our publications...</a>
