	Many seeking to deepen their spiritual life study Gurudeva's trilogy on Hindu philosophy, culture and metaphysics as daily lessons drawn from each of the three booksideally during their regular daily period of worship and meditation. There are 365 lessons in all, one for each day of the year. Most choose to receive the <a href="http://www.feedblitz.com/f/?Sub=&Publisher=7522423&portal=331383">lesson of the day via e-mail</a>. The daily lesson is also available <a href="/livespiritually/become-student/todays-lesson">here</a>. Others prefer to read the lesson of the day in the <a href="http://www.minimela.com/index.php?main_page=index&amp;cPath=69_70">physical books</a> to fully enjoy the printed word and colorful artwork. Those seeking a formal, guided study are invited to enroll in the <a href="/livespiritually/become-student">Master Course Self-Evaluation Study</a>. It includes a series of self-assessment exercises to help students proactively apply Gurudevas mystical teachings to their lives in meaningful ways.
