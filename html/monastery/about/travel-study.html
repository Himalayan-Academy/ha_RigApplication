	A wonderful way to deeply explore the teachings of Kauais Hindu Monastery is to join Bodhinatha and the monks on one of their special travel-study programs. We call these journeys Innersearch because each one is a pilgrimage to the divine and spectacular inside of you. The beauty, color and exotic grandeur of the outer voyage to exotic places like India, Cambodia, Malaysia and Australia is but a reflection of the bliss and richness of the inner voyage. A typical day includes morning explorations into the vast realms of meditation, instructional satsanga on how to live a spiritually dynamic life, and special visits to ashrams and temples. There are hatha yoga periods, question-and-answer sessions and lots of time for informal sharing with the monks, as we delve within together through worship, yoga and fellowship. Innersearch is not your run-of-the-mill vacation but a travel adventure combining Hindu spirituality with a well-deserved retreat from your day-to-day routine. It can be a life-changing experience like none other you will ever have. <a href="/livespiritually/innersearch">More about Innersearch...</a>
