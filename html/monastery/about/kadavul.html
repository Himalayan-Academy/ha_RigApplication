Ring the bell and say a prayer to Lord Ganesha at His outdoor shrine near the monastery entry and proceed up the 300-foot-long pathway lined with ferns, flowering trees and sprawling banyans. Leave the world behind as you encounter the massive 16-ton statue of Nandi the bull, carved from a single block of black granite. On watch at every Siva temple in the world, he represents the perfect devotee, his eyes never veering from his Lord. Remove your shoes, dip your feet in the temple tank and step inside the sanctuary. Experience the darshan (sight) of the Gods, and feel the blessed energy. In the center shrine stands the Divine Dancer, Supreme God Siva. To the left is the portly elephant-faced Deity, Ganesha, whom we greet first and pray to before every important task. To the right is Lord Karttikeya, God of yoga and spiritual striving. Directly in front of Siva is a giant crystal Sivalingam that will one day be the central icon in <a href="/monastery/temples/iraivan">Iraivan Temple</a>. The inner walls of the temple display 108 golden statues of Lord Siva, each depicting one pose of His cosmic dance of creation, preservation, absorption, and the paired graces which conceal and reveal. In the temples right rear corner is a shrine featuring a golden image of Gurudeva where you can honor the great soul who founded this extraordinary complex. Kadavul is an ancient Tamil word for God meaning, He who is both immanent and transcendent. A temple is a meeting place of our physical plane and the invisible worlds of the Gods and angelic beings, or devas. The spiritual vibration is kept strong through the monks continual worship, and the Sanskrit puja ritual they have performed every three hours around the clock since the temples inception in 1973. Mystically, Kadavul is a fire temple, with an intense, penetrating energy that breaks up old patterns and helps seekers begin new ones. The monastery allows access to this private shrine for worship at the daily 9am Siva puja, as the monastic priest performs a centuries-old rite to invoke God Sivas grace and blessings for one and all.  <a href="/monastery/temples/kadavul">More about Kadavul...</a>
