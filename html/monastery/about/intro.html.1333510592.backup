	This booklet explores the origins and mission of this monastery/temple complex known in India as an aadheenam describing its philosophy, temples and areas of service. The monastery's guru lineage is rooted in the Tamil Saiva tradition of Sri Lanka and South India. This ancient spiritual path was brought to America by <a href="/monastery/satgurus/gurudeva/">Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami</a> (Gurudeva, 1927-2001) and continues today under his successor, <a href="/monastery/satgurus/bodhinatha/"> Satguru Bodhinatha Veylanswami</a>. The monastery is blessed with extraordinary beauty, even for Hawaii. It is also the site of intense activity and global religious outreach, where the resident monks wield the latest high-tech computing power to produce <a href="http://www.hinduismtoday.com/">Hinduism Today magazine</a>, books, websites, videos, teaching programs and <a href="http://www.hheonline.org/">Hindu Heritage Endowment</a>. Its two temples, which you may visit, are dedicated to Lord Siva. Using the navigation links to the right, enjoy, now, a magical place blessed by God, Gods, guru and nature.
