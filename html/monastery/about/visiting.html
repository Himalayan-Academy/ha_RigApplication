	A formal guided tour of the temples and sacred grounds of Kauai's Hindu Monastery is conducted every six or seven days. Please call 1-888-735-1619 for upcoming tour dates and to reserve your space. On all days, Kadavul Temple is open from 9am to noon, with a Siva puja conducted from 9:00 to 10:30. The sacred Rudraksha forest at 7345 Kuamo'o Road is available for meditation from 6am to 6pm. We ask visitors to bring an umbrella and to wear modest clothing--no shorts, short dresses, T-shirts or tank tops. Polo shirts are okay. Hindu dress is ideal. And, remember, it's always prudent, even in paradise, not to leave valuables in your car. <a href="/visit">More about visiting...</a>
