<h1 class="h1">Our Two Temples</h1>
<p>Gurudeva founded two remarkable, holy temples on the monastery property which serve as the spiritual center of monastic life and to uplift pilgrims and visitors.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Kadavul Temple</h2>
<p><img src="/html/monastery/temples/kadavul/img/kadavul.jpg" class="float-left" /> Kadavul is our Siva Nataraja temple, established in 1973, where the monks worship and meditate together each morning. There is a sixteen-ton Nandi bull who worships Siva day and night from his pavilion out front. <a href="/monastery/temples/kadavul">More...</a></p>

<h2 class="h2">Iraivan Temple</h2>
<p class="p1"><img src="/html/monastery/temples/iraivan/img/iraivan_temple01.jpg" class="float-left" />
Iraivan is our Sivalingam temple, currently under construction. It began with Gurudeva's vision of God Siva in 1975; carving began in India in 1990; and assembly at Kauai's Hindu Monastery began in 2001. This is a painting of how the temple will ultimately look. <a href="/monastery/temples/iraivan">More...</a></p>
