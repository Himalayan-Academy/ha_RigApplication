	Next, the path climbs a 22-foot-high hillock. At the top amid shade-giving bamboo is poised a 12-foot-tall black granite sculpture of the vel of Lord Murugan, signifying spiritual knowledge and insight, surrounded by a six-sided lava-rock bench. The hill overlooks a sizable expanse of the Sanctuary, including the pristine wildlife marshes to the East.

	Continuing down the hill, one encounters the various Gardens of Discovery, shaded nooks and benches under two rows of Indian golden shower trees, a tree sacred to God Siva and called konrai in Tamil, offering time for reflective thinking and rest.
