	The straight path to God culminates at a sacred Chola-style pavilion with twelve white granite columns rising into a roof seeming to float in space. The pavilion is both shrine and meditation hall. At its center is a large, naturally-formed lava rock Sivalingam surrounded by four other boulders. This is the site of Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami's 1975 mystic vision of Lord Siva which inspired and catalyzed the creation of the San Marga Iraivan Temple and Sanctuary. Elaborate, colorful murals in traditional South Indian style adorn the ceiling, depicting Gurudeva's vision.
