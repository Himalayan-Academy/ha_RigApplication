	The Path of San Marga, or Straight Path to God, culminates at a large, naturally formed lava-rock Sivalingam surrounded by four smaller boulders, just as seen by Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami in his 1975 mystic vision of Lord Siva which inspired and catalyzed the creation of the San Marga Iraivan Temple and Sanctuary. A sacred Chola-style pavilion—both shrine and meditation  hall—will be erected here, with twelve white columns rising into a roof that seems to float in space. Elaborate, colorful murals in traditional South Indian style will adorn the ceiling, depicting Gurudeva's vision.
