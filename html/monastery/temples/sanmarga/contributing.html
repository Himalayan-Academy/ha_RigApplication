	A Unique Opportunity
</h4>
<p>
	Iraivan is a big project, requiring $16 million, which includes an endowment to support it forever. It is a temple made to last a thousand years, one you can return to lifetime after lifetime to enjoy. Join with the many who are a vital part of this unique vision, bringing India's finest art and culture to the US. Become a part of the international group of devotees who have contributed more than $10 million. Six million dollars is yet to be raised before the temple is formally dedicated. Catch the vision! There are many ways you can help complete Hinduism's Island Temple!
</p>
<h4 class="h4">
	Sponsor
</h4>
<p>
	Many families have come forward to sponsor a part of the temple or area of the Sanctuary. For example, two of the temple's side towers have been sponsored for $50,000 each. Others are sponsoring one of 168 lotus stones on the railing ($1,008) and individual pillars ($21,000). Sponsorship works well as a community or extended family project where pledged money is raised over a period of time, such as by craft sales, eBay auctions or cultural dinner events.
</p>
<h4 class="h4">
	Pledge
</h4>
<p>
	The most common form of helping is a monthly pledge. Many devotees set up an automatic charge on their credit card or bank account of $50, $100, $500 or more. We rely on such regular monthly pledges to support the daily carving work in India and assembly work on Kauai. Monthly pledges from devotees around the world presently provide the stable core of Iraivan's income.

	Love Offering
</h4>
<p>
	Feeling generous today? Fulfill your inspiration by sending a few hundred dollars to the San Marga Sanctuary or Iraivan Temple project. Some unexpected money just fell in your lap? Before you fritter it away, take a moment to consider making that long-planned, one-time love offering. A loved one passed away and named you in the will? Honor him or her and distinguish yourself by using a portion to create something permanent. Donations can be specified for the Iraivan Temple Building Fund, the Iraivan Temple Endowment or the San Marga Sanctuary Development Fund.

	Looking to the Future
</h4>
<p>
	We anticipate that the construction of Iraivan Temple will be finished within the lifetime of most of our donors. However, the development of the surrounding San Marga Sanctuary and adjacent monastery cloister will continue for decades to come. There are important halls and shrines to build, and further landscaping work, including paths and waterways. It is an enormous project, for which additional funds are needed, well beyond the $16 million needed for the main temple construction and endowment.

<p>
	To give us the ability to fulfill all the needs of San Marga, we have created the San Marga Sanctuary Development Fund. We sincerely invite you to make a gift to this fund in your will, revocable living trust, charitable remainder trust or a life-insurance policy. All are effective means of giving to the San Marga Sanctuary Development Fund to provide for the future manifestation of the Sanctuary.
</p>
<h5 class="h5">
	Will
</h5>
<p>
	There are four primary ways you can make a gift in your will. They are:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>a percentage of your estate</li>
	<li>a fixed dollar amount</li>
	<li>specific property, such as stocks, bonds or real estate</li>
	<li>the balance of your estate</li>
</ol>
<h5 class="h5">
	Life Insurance
</h5>
<p>
	Gifts of life insurance are accomplished by naming San Marga Sanctuary Development Fund the beneficiary, co-beneficiary or contingent beneficiary of your life insurance. If you transfer actual ownership of the policy to the Development Fund, or buy a new policy for its benefit, such a gift would entitle you to an income tax deduction, and future premium payments would be tax deductible.

<h5 class="h5">
	Revocable Living Trust
</h5>
<p>
	Gifts through a revocable living trust follow the same pattern as a will, and the same four ways of making a gift apply.
</p>
<h5 class="h5">
	Charitable Remainder Trust
</h5>
<p>
	You can name San Marga Sanctuary Development Fund as the charitable beneficiary or as one of a number of charitable beneficiaries of your trust remainder.
</p>
<p>
	The correct wording for a bequest is as follows: "I give (percentage of my estate, stated sum of money, designated property, or balance of estate) to the San Marga Sanctuary Development Fund of Hindu Heritage Endowment, a charitable trust whose Federal Employer Identification Number is 99-0308924, located at 107 Kaholalele, Road, Kapaa, Hawaii, 96746-9304, USA."
