</h3>
<p>
There is no restriction on the frequency. However, the total amount of foreign exchange purchased from or remitted through, all sources in India during the current financial year should be within the limit of USD $200,000.

The facility under the Scheme is in addition to those already available for private travel, business travel, studies, medical treatment, etc. , as described in Schedule III of Foreign Exchange Management (Current Account Transactions) Rules, 2000. The Scheme can also be used for these purposes. However, remittances for gift and donation can not be made separately and have to be made under the Scheme only.
