<h1> The History of Iraivan Temple </h1>
<h2> A Timeline Overview</h2>

<p>[BR Notes: We will need to establish a design format. Assuming there is not much to say for a given year... each year can be a single list item in an unordered list.  I have simple "banged in" whatever I can remember might be significant, without dates. If anyone has an historical document on the server I can look at we will refine this... it is presently not links and undiscoverable by search engines. I have attempted to add a slightly descriptive working to the beginning of this, as I believe this makes for something more interesting than a mere list of dates and simple event phrase. This could be change to have a simple label after the date, which would pop down for a more verbose, richer description(s)</p>
