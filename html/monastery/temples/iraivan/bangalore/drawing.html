<h1 class="h1">Implementing the Design: Drawing on stones</h1>

	<p>The intricate ornate carvings for Iraivan Temple depends on precise symmetry drawings. At the carving site in Bangalore, drawings on stones are made using sharpened coal and bamboo (sharpened shoots.) Repetitive designs are traced out of zinc stencils while the rest are drawn free-hand. The bamboo 'pencils' are dipped into red oxide for the markings. This is also used to soak Nylon strings, stretched from one end to another and snapped to mark long straight lines. Figures or designs are drawn on plywood or wall surfaces as a guide and reference. After each phase of carving the sthapati makes more lines for the silpi to work on. </p>
