    <h1 class="h1">From Stone Quarry to Temple</h1>

    <p>Enormous blocks of stones are taken out of the mountains of Avanahalli, Hessaragatta and Magadi in Bangalore and Padhimalai Kuppam in Kanchipuram, by driving long chisels into the rock and carefully cracking it in perfectly straight lines. Then after transporting it to the carving site, the stones are gradually transformed into a work of art by the devoted shilpis, who slowly chip away at it, hour after hour, day after day, using only hammer and chisel. Just seeing the large white and red stones and realizing this is Iraivan Temple taking shape, our vision and dream for so many years finally manifesting on the earth plane, is quite a wonderful feeling.</p>
    
<p> [NOTE FOR EDITORS: To see the original block of images from the original page:
 <a href="http://himalayanacademy.com/ssc/bangalore/Quarry.html" target="_blank"> click here. this was done with a complex table layout (horrible code!) </a> that was not supported by HappyCog CSS.<br /><br />
 Following Happy Cog's pure semantic code model, I used the leanest possible table code and then added minimal support in the CSS for an image panel like this. See the ".image-panel" and ".image-panel td" selectors in the style.css. the design concept is very simple: layout images in single row tables top to bottom, these center, no borders, add generous padding for the "open" look that we have adopted. That's it.] <br /><br /></p>
