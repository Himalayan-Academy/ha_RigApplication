    <h1 class="h1">The Basic Phases of Manifesting a Stone Temple</h1>

    <h2 class="h2">All Hindu temples were once just an idea and a mountain of uncleft rock. The extraordinary process of manifesting the vision is nine parts hard work, one part magic.</h2>

    <p>In very simple terms here is the journey from stone quarry to finished temple.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>A sthapati (sculptor-architect) is hired. He drafts a traditional temple design.</li>

        <li>Ceremonies invoke Lord Ganesha's blessings. Stone quarrying begins.</li>

        <li>A site is chosen for the carving. A workshop and home are erected for a team of blacksmiths and sculptors who move to the site with their families.</li>

        <li>Stone arrive by lorry. One team cuts the stones to size, another into basic shapes, and the third sculpts them to final form.</li>

        <li>The sthapati draws precise chalk lines on the stone to indicate the mass to be removed.</li>

        <li>He repeats this step every eight hours for the duration of the carving.</li>

        <li>A fourth crew polishes the stone using stone bars.</li>

        <li>Carving complete, the pieces are stored in sand for protection until shipped to the final location, where they are fitted and assembled.</li>

        <li>Elaborate santification ceremonies open the temple.</li>
    </ul>
