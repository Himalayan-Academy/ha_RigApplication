<p>
	On 10 October 1997 Iraivan carving site celebrated Ayutha Puja for the 7th year. The work site was beautifully decorated with colorful banners and 'thoranam.' Work went on as usual but ended a little earlier. At about 6.00 pm everyone gathered for Puja at Gurudeva's tiruvadi and the replica of Crystal Lingam. It was the silpis' day, smiles and laughter was everywhere. The atmosphere was full of joy. All the tools used on site was being displayed and worshipped, seeking blessings from God and Gods. Puja was also done at various sections of the worksite including the Blacksmith shed. Each silpi renewed their trade skills by chipping on a granite stone specially placed infront of the altar. Each worker of Iraivan was given new vesthi, dakshina and a fruit. Chidambaram Sthapati gave a very assuring speech on behalf of Ganapati Sthapati and all the silpis. A feast was held with plenty to eat and take home. This has been yet another great day in Bangalore Iraivan carving site. Aum Namasivaya.

	This is the 7th year we are celebrating the Ayutha Puja at the Bangalore Carving Site. Ganapathi Sthapati was with us at this time last year but is unable to join because of his health condition. Iraivan Temple Carving site is a complete 'Tirupani' (worksite). Our carving site is not an ordinary place. We have grown and gained recognition and acknowledgement worldwide as respectable templebuilders. This is all through the grace of our Gurudeva. We have seen and worked in many other temple projects. There may be many places we could work and earn a living but It remains a fact that there is no other site in India like the one here. We are all very gifted to be working here. Here at Iraivan worksite we are all like brothers in a family. We shall work sincerely until the completion of Iraivan Temple. We thank the Manager of the site, Kulapathi Jiva Rajasankara and his family and pledge to continue working closely with him in our efforts to complete this project and gained Gurudeva's full blessings.
