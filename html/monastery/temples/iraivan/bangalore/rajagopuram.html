	Stones for Temple Entrance Tower
</h2>
<p>
	The Dwara Gopuram (temple main entrance tower ) is being carved in 8 separate courses and will be assembled accordingly. From left - 'Upagreevam, Karnakoodu Vehigai, Karnakoodu Manjam and Kandam, Karnakoodu Pandagai, First Storey Prastharam, Vethigai and Povukkal, Kandam-Kalabhusanam and Shikaram.' Once completed the tower will be 10 feet and half inch in height and 11 feet seven one quarter inches wide. The <i>shikaram</i> (top capstone of the tower&mdash;first in the series below) is carved from a single stone, it is 3 feet tall and 2 feet three inches wide. The center section will be made hollow to reduce its weight. Five Sthupis (Spires) covered with gold will go on top of the <i>shikaram</i> stone.
