	Silpi Worship
</h1>
<p>
	San Marga Iraivan Temple Carving Site in Bangalore India is becoming a sacred pilgrimage location. Foreign and local pilgrims come from time to time to witness the creation of the all-white granite temple to be erected in Kauai,Hawaii.

	Meanwhile the silpis arise and worship together each day, chant, sing, and at seven thirty sharp begin the tap-tap-tapping of their iron chisel in a symphony of creativity manifesting Iraivan slowly but surely.
