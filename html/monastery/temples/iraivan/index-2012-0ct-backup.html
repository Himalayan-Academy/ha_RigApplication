 <p>Iraivan is our Sivalingam temple, currently under construction. It began with Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami's vision of God Siva in 1975; carving began in India in 1990; and assembly at Kauai's Hindu Monastery began in 2001. </p>

						<p>"One early morning, before dawn, a three-fold vision of Lord Siva came to me. First I beheld Lord Siva walking in a valley, then I saw His face peering into mine, then He was seated on a large stone, His reddish golden hair flowing down His back. That was February 15, 1975.This was the fulfillment of the quest for a vision of what the future might hold, which led me and my followers to the lovely Garden Island of Kauai, held the most sacred of all by the Hawaiian peoples long, long ago. It is alongside the sacred Wailua River, leading to the top of Mt. Waialeale, that this place of pilgrimage is being built, a temple of kaivalya, granting freedom from the past and a vision for the future. The temple's 700-pound 50-million-years-in-the-making crystal icon is a <i>kalpaka</i> (spiritual wish-fulfilling) ever-giving Sivalingam. So many blessings await each pilgrim. None are ever neglected."</p>

       <p>[General Temple Project Description Goes Here, I just dropped in the thermometer here for kicks. and also at the bottom of  the side bar if we want it to appear on all Iraivan pages which is my recommendation. The stewards and Bodhinatha did want us to make the fund raising effort "come to the top" of these pages and not just have them "talk story." Otherwise people thinks it's all done. ]</p>

            <img src="images/iraivan_temple01.jpeg" align="left" /> With little fanfare, the first hand-carved, all-stone Hindu temple ever erected in the Western Hemisphere is slowly taking shape on a Hawaiian island in the mid-Pacific Ocean. It began, as Hindu temples traditionally do, with a vision. Early morning on February 15, 1975, Lord Siva appeared in an ethereal vision to Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami (Gurudeva) at his ashram on the island of Kauai. Gurudeva resolved to permanently capture the immense spiritual power of that vision. Thus was born the Iraivan Temple, its riverside site already sacred to the ancient Hawaiian people. <i>Iraivan</i>, "He who is worshiped," is one of the oldest words for God in the ancient Tamil language. From the beginning, the temple, located at the foot of an extinct volcano on the northernmost of the Hawaiian Islands, was conceived to be as rare as the vision that birthed it. Already the Americas had Hindu temples, but this was destined to be unique, a hand-carved white-granite edifice to be brought stone by stone from India, to reflect the ultimate in craftsmanship and design and to be surrounded with as beautiful a setting as the paradise island could allow. He directed that all aspects of the construction were to be engineered to last more than one thousand years--an ambitious goal by Western standards, though many temples of such age and older exist in India today.</p>
            <p>Nearly every recent temple--and thousands have resulted from the last few decades' explosion of Hindu devotion--has adapted modern methods of brick and concrete, steel and wood to the ancient designs. Cost and the time required to build were thus reduced, but at the expense of longevity and beauty, for plaster--no matter how skillfully applied--never equals the power or permanence of stone. In August, 1987, Subramuniyaswami acquired a giant quartz crystal--a <i>sphatika</i> Sivalingam--to enshrine in the Chola-style temple. At 700-plus pounds and 39 inches tall, it is the largest six-sided, single-pointed crystal ever found. Natural stones are used in Siva temples to "mark" the presence of God beyond all forms and qualities. Scriptures decree that, of all possible kinds of stone, crystal makes the supreme Sivalingam. The temple's Tamil architect, who visits the island site regularly, believes the crystal Lingam to be the greatest wonderment of this temple--"If all the crystal <i>lingams</i> in India were put together into one, they would still not equal the power of this one crystal."</p>
            <p><br />
            <img src="images/iraivan_temple02.jpeg" align="right" /> <b>Master builder:</b> Our current architect is Selvanathan Sthapathi who trained for years under the temple's designer, Thiru V. Ganapati Sthapati, former principal of the Government College of Architecture in Tamil Nadu, arguably India's greatest living builder, was hired. Gurudeva decided to have the stones carved, all 3.2 million pounds, in Bangalore. He directed builders to follow and preserve the old methods, shaping the stone with simple chisels and hammers, and not to use any modern rock-cutting equipment. Even the quarrying was to be done by hand, for the architect explained that rock blasted out with dynamite is subtly shattered and loses the pure "tone" of hand-quarried stone. To him, rock is a living element, not inert, and the sound of the granite, which he terms "its song," is a key part of the spiritual integrity of the temple.</p>
            <p><b>Help from India:</b> Two eminent swamis with hundreds of thousands of followers--Sri Sri Sri Sivaratnapuri Mahaswamigal (popularly known as Tiruchi Swami) and Sri Sri Sri Balagangadharanathaswami--came forward to assist with the project, and in 1990 provided eleven acres of land outside Bangalore [see page 17]. There, a village was built, and 75 <i>silpis,</i> traditional stone carvers, were hired, and their families moved to the San Marga Iraivan Temple carving site, the only facility in the nation with Internet access and a retirement program. As we completed the bulk of the carving there, the site was moved and fewer silpis were needed. Today there are 20-30 carvers at the village.</p>
            <p><b>Financial strategy:</b> By the late 1980s, the extraordinary 51-acre temple lands on Kauai were paid off and sufficient money raised to begin construction. From the beginning it has been a "pay as you go" project. Gurudeva's edict is as simple as it is unusual: build this temple with no loans and no debts.</p>
            <p>It was Gurudeva's intention from the beginning to not only construct this unique temple, but to simultaneously endow it. Thus, of the <sup>us</sup>$16-million-dollar fundraising goal, approximately half is for building the temple and related facilities, landscaping, etc., and half provides a yearly income to maintain and improve the temple regardless of future economic conditions. So far, $2 million has been contributed by devotees in 45 countries. When asked when the temple will be completed, the monks reply, "Progress depends on contributions. There is no completion deadline. Realistically, the temple will take another decade, and only when the full $16 million is raised will our San Marga Iraivan Temple be formally dedicated." The building of Iraivan is equal to its completion.</p>
            <p><b>Why on a remote island?</b> "Why not build this beautiful and not inexpensive edifice in a more convenient location--say Sacramento, California," one critic asked, "rather than in the middle of nowhere?" The monks explain: because that is where the vision took place. There are many pilgrimage destinations in remote places. For example, millions trek each year to the Ayyappan shrine at Sabarimala, hidden in a South Indian jungle. On the mystical side, Gurudeva explains, pilgrimage is not supposed to be easy--witness the dangers faced by hundreds of thousands of Hindus who trek annually into the desolate Himalayan mountains, facing blizzards and fearing landslides. While the greatest hazard of pilgrimage to idyllic Kauai is a serious sunburn on the beach or getting wet in the rain, the oceanic remoteness does require serious commitment from those pursuing real spiritual progress. The public reaction from Hindus and non-Hindus alike is enthusiastic--local Kauaians are delighted to have such a masterpiece on their island, which takes pride in its cultural diversity, especially one that is close to the island's ancient Hawaiian and contemporary Buddhist religious heritage [see page 34].</p>
