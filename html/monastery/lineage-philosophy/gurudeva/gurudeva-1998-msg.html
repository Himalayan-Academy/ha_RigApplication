    <h1 class="h1"><b><font size="4">"The following messages came in from great souls around the world and were read to Gurudeva by the members of the Singapore Mission the evening of his 72nd Jayanthi party at the Kilohana Carriage House.</font></b></h1>

    <p><font size="4" face="Palatino"><b>From the Srikantha family:</b> Our Great Guru has impacted our lives on such a deep and lasting level, it is impossible to find any corner where his grace has not uplifted and guided us along this straight path. We are a sucess as a family by his kindness and attention. We enjoy all that is right and good by his tender and firm direction. We face all that is challenging and arduous by his disciplined example. For over thirty years he has been the light I have focused on for vision and understanding. His wisdom has brought me back time and time again to the straight path he holds out for us. There is no other being on the planet that means more to me than Our beloved Gurudeva. Our hearts and energies surrender at His Perfect Feet on this day marking yet one more grand fulfillment by His Holyness Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami.</font></p>

    <p><font size="4" face="Palatino"><b>The Manick family of Goodlands, Mauritius,</b> wish to express its gratitude to the unprecedented religious upliftment which Gurudeva has brought to the Hindus of the little island of Mauritius. For our family we feel that life would have been a real havoc without having a Guru. We now feel confident and secure for the generations to come because the way Gurudeva has presented Saiva Siddhanta is eradicating many misconceptions in the minds of Hindus, especially the youth. Thank you Gurudeva for all the divine energies that have been sent to inspire everyone in Mauritius. Some it seems Mauritius will be an outstanding platform for Hinduism in the Indian Ocean. Aum.</font></p>

    <p><font size="4" face="Palatino"><b>From the Kanda Chelvarajah family:</b> Jai Gurudeva Jai! Long live Gurudeva! It is not accident we had the opportunity to study your books and learn more about our own religion as well our religious Jaffna culture. As we have our karmas to resolve we try our best to follow your instructions to the best of our abilities. We hope Gurudeva's grace will be with us to guide us through thick and thin.</font></p>

    <p><font size="4" face="Palatino"><b>From Eric Burkett:</b> Since I began writing about religion for the Anchorage Daily News, his works "Dancing With Siva," and "Loving Ganesha" have proven invaluable to me in my efforts to cover our city's small, but certainly vital Hindu community. "Hinduism Today" has also proven to be a continual source of enlightenment, and I've certainly come to appreciate the patience of the magazine's staff as they fielded calls from the befuddled reporter in Anchorage trying to make heads or tails of traditions and doctrines of which he knew nothing. Sivaya Subramuniyaswami's influence is generous and far reaching and has, I hope, helped make me a better journalist. Best wishes.</font></p>

    <p><font size="4" face="Palatino"><b>From the Kulapati Adi Alahan family:</b> Prostrations to Gurudeva! Gurudeva's guidance and love in our families life is the greatest anchor to help us through our everyday life to an ever increasing understanding of what life is all about! Recently while in a big chain bookstore, I saw Hinduism Today in the magazine section, and the new edition of Dancing with Siva in the Hindu section of religion, I am so pleased to know that Gurudeva's knowledge is being made available as much as possible. This reminds me of Gurudeva talking with Carl Sagan, Al Gore or Micheal Gorbachev. This knowledge is so helpful at this point in time. It is the kind of peace, serenity, security and love that all people yearn for. Jai Gurudeva! All our love, Aum shanti.</font></p>

    <p><font size="4" face="Palatino"><b>From Loganatha and Yatrika Shivam:</b> Getting to know Gurudeva and experiencing His Grace has been a turning point in the lives of many people. The mere fact that as two individuals born and raised in a Muslim country such as Iran, we have converted to Hinduism, is rare and amazing. The revelation that we are Hindu souls who for some reason or another have been born into non-Hindu families, came to us through the grace of our Guru. There are a number of us of Iranian origin, whose lives have been touched in one way or another by meeting Gurudeva and finding out about his teachings. Some of us have been fortunate to keep closer contact with him; nevertheless, there is not one among us whose soul and spirit have remained unchanged by such an encounter. Who would have thought that getting to know Gurudeva and buying one small soapstone Ganesh would have led Loganatha and his brother Palaka over the years to open Koan Collection, a store which has played an important part in bringing Hinduism in one form or another into the lives of many Los Angeles inhabitants? So many customers have told us that their lives have been changed by establishing Hindu shrines in their homes; others come to the peaceful atmosphere of Koan, just to take a break from the turmoil of their surroundings. We believe that this is all through Gurudeva's grace. Since Gurudeva's blessing our union, there has been ever increasing harmony, respect, understanding, devotion, and love in our marital relationship. Gurudeva's teachings are always there, like a gentle yet stern reminder, whenever we veer from our paths. We have never felt so confident and secure, because after all these years and at long last, we have finally reached not just the intellectual but the innate understanding of why we are here. More than anything else, Gurudeva and his exemplary religious order have opened our eyes to the enormous potentials of every creature, and the Divine within each one of us. Happy birthday dear Gurudeva! Thank you for everything you have given us. May this new cycle in your earthly life be a wondrous journey! Aum Namasivaya!</font></p>

    <p><font size="4" face="Palatino"><b>From Sarkunavathy Sockanathan:</b> To My Beloved Gurudeva, HAPPY GURU JAYANTHI!!! Gurudeva has taught me lot of things exspecially to overcome problems in my life. I faced a lot of problems, exspecially with friends and I always ask my self, why my friends doing this to me? Am I not fit enough to be their friends? But, when I started to follow Gurudeva's teachings. I find my self free from sadness, worry and etc.... Now, I have more confidence and I'm no more worriying about friends because I know their creating problems because of their ignorance! Not only that, Gurudeva's teachings has helped lot of souls to realize the ultimate reason why they were born in this world. So, now I want to thank our Lord Siva for introducing me to our GREAT SARGURU SIVAYA SUBRAMUNIYASWAMI! Gurudeva, thank you very very much for all your teachings, guidance, love .......

    <p><font size="4" face="Palatino"><b>From Bawani Selvaraj of Malaysia:</b> As Gurudeva's devotee, I am indeed much debted to Gurudeva whose teaching is spreading widely in Malaysia. Wherever you go, one is able to meet Gurudeva's devotees compared to the last fifteen years. The tree of Hinduism is firmly planted here in Malaysia. I am looking forward for this much awaited celebration. On a personal note, thank you Gurudeva for your love, assistance and guidance. Aum Namasivaya. Vanakam Anbe Sivamayam</font></p>

    <p><font size="4" face="Palatino">From the Kulapati Selladurai Perakasam Family: Prostration to the Lotus feet of Lord Vinayaga and our Beloved Satguru. Gurudeva has been a very inspirational guru for our family. Our search for a guru ended the moment we were introduced to the teachings of Gurudeva. There was no need to go further as it is complete and most of all it is traditional saivite. Gurudeva has been able to transform our life from an ordinary Indian to a complete Hindu. The depth of his teachings either through his written works or his upadesh are very inspirational and we are blessed to be in touch with a moksha guru. Although I am unable to make it personally to Adheenam to participate in this joyous occasion, we know that Gurudeva is always with us. May I take this oppurtunity to wish Gurudeva a happy GURU JAYANTI.</font></p>

    <p><font size="4" face="Palatino"><b>From Barathy Sockanathan of Malaysia:</b> Gurudeva, is my LIGHT. He light up my life which was so dark.Gurudeva,is my everything. My life is for Him .He changed my whole life, he changed myself,he changed my character,my prinsip,my thoughts.He taught me 'Who AM I?', 'Where Am I Going','God','World','Soul'and all about life.In other word,the 'old' Barathy is dying and now a 'new' Barathy is being produced! I can't imagine how my life would be without our dearest Satguru.Gurudeva has a big impact on life not only in me but also to so many people in Malaysia.This can realized when I talk about Gurudeva to them and hear it from other people about their testimony.Myself and other 'soul' are trying our level best to spread Gurudeva's teaching and to help continue Gurudeva's work in our country by giving Children Classes, promoting and selling Hinduism Today Magazine and His books, do Sivathondu by washing temple, help the need and poor and disable people and so on. I'm so thankful to Lord Ganesha for 'sending' Satguru for us. A small poem for Gurudeva who always will be there for me as Guru,Father and a Best Friend ; to my beloved Satguru... GURUDEVA, YOU MEAN MORE TO ME WITH EVERY PASSING YEAR... GURUDEVA, YOU'VE GIVEN ME SO MUCH; and HAVE ASKED SO LITTLE IN RETURN. YOU GUIDED ME,BUT YET LET ME GO MY OWN WAY.YOU SET A FINE EXAMPLE, AS YOU PATIENTLY TAUGHT ME YOUR LESSONS IN LIFE. YOU TAUGHT ME TO BE STRONG-STRONG ENOUGH TO COPE WITH DISAPPOINTMENTS AND HARD TIMES AND STRONG ENOUGH TO LIVE WITH ANY WEAKNESS I MAY HAVE. GURUDEVA, YOU TAUGHT ME COURAGE- TO BE BRAVE ENOUGH TO DO WHAT I BELIEVE IS RIGHT. YOU TAUGHT ME THE VALUE OF KNOWLEDGE- SO THAT I WOULD BE PREPARED TO MAKE DECISIONS, BIG AND SMALL- SO THAT WHEN I MADE MISTAKES, I WOULD TRY TO LEARN FROM THEM, AND THEN GO ON FROM THERE. OFTEN I FIND MYSELF THINKING OF YOU GURUDEVA .... OF THE SUPPORT, AND ENCOURGEMENT YOU'VE GIVEN ME OVER THE YEARS, OF YOUR GENEROSITY,KINDNESS, AND GUIDANCE, AND ESPECIALLY OF THE MANY CORRESPONDS AND TALKS WE'VE HAD TOGETHER, AND IT'S WHEN I THINK OF THESE THINGS, THAT I REALIZE HOW MUCH GURUDEVA HAS HELPED ME TO KNOW THE 'LIFE'. BUT MOST OF ALL, GURUDEVA, YOU TAUGHT ME ABOUT LOVE BY SETTING AN EXAMPLE WITH YOUR OWN GENTLENESS AND OPENNESS AND WARMTH. YOU HAVE ENRICHED MY LIFE FOREVER WITH YOUR LESSONS AND YOUR LOVE... AND I THANK YOU FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART. GURUDEVA, YOU HAVE MADE ME PEACE AND HAPPY, TO HAVE A GURU, AS FINE AS YOU.</font></p>

    <p><font size="4" face="Palatino"><b>From Brahmachari Rajadeva Alahan:</b> I have been asked to relate an instance or two how Gurudeva has helped me on the Spiritual Path. But, I cannot remember a time when Gurudeva has not helped me. Even in the silence of his blessings during times of need he helps in inner ways that are beyond human conceptualization. Even his very existence in my life sustains me and gives me hope, understanding, Divine guidance, and Great Joy. There are many experiences that I may draw upon, which taken together will give a thread of continuity; and I could mention them here in a way that would paint an artist's landscape of unfolding colors and patterns, one on top of the other; brush strokes of the Artist Satguru's hand which crafts and details his Sishya in a very inner way to produce a scene of unparalleled beauty. I have seen this beauty within myself; and over the years, I have seen others unfold spiritually at his hand into beings of inner light, wisdom, joy, and unparalleled beauty. Gurudeva's first personal teaching to me was on the use of one's willpower, as recorded in the Know Thyself booklet: "...The more willpower you use, the more you have to use. It is an unlimited power within you. Finish each job that you begin. Keep each promise that you make. Fulfill each plan that you have set in motion, provided it is true, kind, helpful and fulfills a need..." Gurudeva's most profound effect on my life is found in his words, "...You are that Spirit in every living soul. You are that which, in his intelligent and ignorant state, everyone is striving for, a realization of that Spirit that you are..." I believe the greatest teaching for us to regard is from the Kulanava Tantra, Guru Protocol, about the power of the Satguru... about the power that Gurudeva holds... "And Lord Siva said, "When the entire universe is looked on as pervaded by the Sivaguru, what mantra can fail to achieve its purpose for the sishya? When the Satguru is present, no tapas is necessary, neither by fasting nor observances, neither pilgrimage nor purifactory bath. What he speaks is as scripture... " "As in the vicinity of fire, butter gets melted, so in the proximity of the holy Sivaguru all bad karmas dissolve. As lighted fire burns up all fuel, dry and moist, so the glance of the Sivaguru burns up in a moment the karmas of the sishya. As the heap of cotton blown up by a great storm scatters in all the ten directions, so the heap of negative karmas is blown away by the compassion of the Sivaguru. As darkness is destroyed at the very sight of the lamp, so is ignorance destroyed at the sight of the holy Sivaguru.' "</font></p>

    <p><font size="4" face="Palatino"><b>From Swami Chidanand Saraswati:</b> Most Respected Gurudev Sivaya Subramuniyaswamiji, I hope that this finds you and all the saints and devotees in the best of health and happiness. I am writing to wish you a very happy 72nd birthday. The birthday of a saint is a great occasion. As we reflect on your dedicated life, we can see that your time here has been the epitome of prayer in action. You are truly able to stand as an example of devotion, commitment and piety. You have achieved more in 72 years than most people can hope to achieve over the course of many lifetimes. This is due to your true divinity. Hinduism Today is a tribute to your boundless devotion. I have seen so many newspapers and magazines on Hinduism and Indian culture. Yours is -- by far -- the best I have ever seen. And each issue gets better. Your articles are compelling, educational, inspiring and uplifting. Your artwork/layout/design is truly graceful. Hinduism Today has really mastered the balance between beauty and simplicity. All of this is due to your grace and guidance. Additionally, your support for the Encyclopedia of Hinduism has been wonderful. The Encyclopedia really is your project. As you are aware, Hinduism holds within it the keys to peace, harmony and enlightenment for the entire world -- for today, for the 21st century and for the future. Hence, it is our responsibility to provide our children with this irreplaceable treasure-chest of wisdom and inspiration; however our presentation must be lucid, meaningful and comprehensive. This is what the Encyclopedia will do. The Encyclopedia of Hinduism is the most important gift we can give to our children and to the world of the future. For, even if they have everything else -- everything Western society can give them -- it is all meaningless without the depth and breadth of their rich heritage. The EH team have the united efforts of over 1250 top, international scholars; we have a prestigious editorial/advisory board; and we have the blessings of the world's top Shankaracharyas and saints like you. With this, it is no surprise that we have made such incredible progress in 10 short years. Hopefully, all people will look to you for guidance and will follow in your footsteps. If this were the case, our world would surely be filled with more peace, harmony and divinity. For you are a living example of service and devotion. Those who are blessed with your satsang receive boundless gifts of wisdom, inspiration and spiritual upliftment. Once again, happy birthday, and may the Lord Almighty continue to bestow His blessings of health, happiness and success upon you. I send you, and all the saints and devotees my deepest blessings and prayers. In the service of God and humanity, Muniji</font></p>
