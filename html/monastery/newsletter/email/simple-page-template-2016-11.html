        <br />

        <p>September 4th at the Aadheenam began with a morning monthly Chitra puja to Gurudeva, followed in the afternoon with the invocation of the Lord of Obstacles at our annual Ganesha Chaturthi festival. A week later, I held webinars on the topic &ldquo;Six Levels of Practice,&rdquo; which emphasizes regular daily practice, known as a vigil, in one&rsquo;s home shrine. My publisher&rsquo;s desk for the January 2017 issue of Hinduism Today, entitled &ldquo;An Alternative to Happiness,&rdquo; received its final editing. The article presents the idea that we can experience a sustainable joy by going inside ourselves into the spiritual power in the spine during our morning vigil. In it are suggestions on how to remain in that consciousness the rest of the day. From October 25 to 29, our 15th Mahasamadhi observance was held, with many devotees coming from off island, including the US, England, Singapore, Malaysia, Canada and Mauritius. On the final day, Kumar Gurukkal performed a powerful homa and abhishekam to Gurudeva with special rituals from the Saiva Agamas that are rarely done. My two classes during the observance were on &ldquo;An Alternative to Happiness&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Power of Kind Words.&rdquo; General contributions for the two-month period of September and October totaled $103,791, which is less than our minimum two-month goal of $130,000. Special project contributions totaled an additional $5,621. We are grateful to our global family of temple builders for your continued and generous support. Aum Namasivaya!</p>

			<p><b>Iraivan Temple Progress</b><br />At the carving site in Bengaluru the work on the perimeter wall, and the large decorative red pots that will sit atop the wall, continues without a break. During his September visit to the worksite, Satguru clearly saw that the completion of the Iraivan Temple carving project in India is rapidly approaching. Our deep gratitude goes out to all who supported the building project last year and allowed us to meet our fundraising goal.</p>
			<p><b>Satguru Bodhinatha Veylanswami&rsquo;s Activities</b><br />
			<p>In early September, Satguru returned from his around-the-world travels and was greeted lovingly by his monks and devotees. In mid September, he held two webinars for his devotees around the world. The class on &ldquo;Six Levels of Practice&rdquo; underlined the importance of a regular daily spiritual practice. On October 15, the monks celebrated Satguru&rsquo;s 74th jayanti, expressing our deep appreciation for the infinite love and blessings he brings into our lives every day. At Divali time, Satguru presided over a four-day observance marking the 15th anniversary of the Grand Departure (Mahasamadhi) of our dear Gurudeva, Sivaya Subramuniyaswami. During this time, Satguru released our latest book (a catechism for youth) entitled Path to Siva. He expounded on lessons from the book in two talks, &ldquo;Hinduism Is Both a Religion and a Way of Life&rdquo; and &ldquo;What Is Hinduism?&mdash;Key Features,&rdquo; which you can listen to on our website.</p>
			<p><b>Monks&rsquo; Travel</b><br />
			<p>During the month of September, Paramacharya Sadasivanathaswami and Sadhaka Rajanatha traveled throughout California, Illinois, Georgia, Colorado, Arizona, Oregon and up to Canada on a four-week journey attending conferences and visiting the homes of devotees. In Los Angeles, they attended the three-day Sages and Scientists Symposium, a gathering of world renowned quantum and astrophysicists, brain scientists, meditators, yoga teachers, cutting-edge researchers and leaders in the field of medicine. They interviewed the founder, Deepak Chopra, as part of an article the magazine will run on the event. In Atlanta, Georgia, they attended the annual Hindu Mandir Executives Conference, one of the most effective Hindu cooperative initiatives in America. Paramacharya&rsquo;s keynote to the participants, representing some 200 temples throughout the continent, was a summary of the California textbook issue and a fun look at ten Hindu megatrends, directions our religion is going in. In Victoria, BC, Swami spoke to 140 seekers about the path, with special reference to the SBNR people of the world, those who are spiritual but not religious. He also met with the teams in Loveland, Colorado, who are working on the bronze statues of our silpi temple builders, congratulating them all at a special dinner for their seven years of work on what we learned is a one-of-a-kind series. There is none like it in America. </p>
			<p><b>Publications and Other Activities</b><br />
			<p>Path to Siva, a Catechism for Youth, consisting of 68 questions and answers on Saivite Hinduism, has been printed in Malaysia. Digital versions&mdash;PDF, eBook &amp; Kindle (Mobi)&mdash;are now available, for free, on our website here: <a href="http://www.himalayanacademy.com/view/path-to-siva">http://www.himalayanacademy.com/view/path-to-siva</a>. In October, we released a free mobile app called Spiritual Workout. It is designed primarily for Hindus who want to maintain a daily spiritual practice, but feel they don&rsquo;t have much time for it. The app has four main areas: worship, introspection, affirmation and study. A workout can be done in as little as ten minutes. Get it for Mac devices at the iTunes Store. The Android version is available on Google Play. Five of our brother monks from the BAPS Swaminarayan fellowship visited during a recent Hawaii tour. Senior among them was Bhadreshswami who authored the &ldquo;Six Streams of Hindu Philosophy&rdquo; educational article for the October-November-December issue of our magazine. Also, Pieter Veltevrede, an extraordinary artist from the Netherlands who has illustrated articles for us in Hinduism Today, visited for three days to work with the monks on several future collaborations. </p>

			<p>Hinduism Today&rsquo;s October/November/December 2016 issue has gone to press and is now available online free of charge at www.hinduismtoday.com. You can also download our free Hinduism Today App and enjoy the full magazine on your mobile device at www.himalayanacademy.com/apps/hinduism-today.</p>
			<p>In this issue&rsquo;s Publisher&rsquo;s Desk, Bodhinatha explains dharma in five aspects: 1) right living; 2) the two paths, grihastha and sannyasa; 3) the four stages of life; 4) the four positive goals&mdash;duty, wealth, love and liberation; and 5) varna, the duties and responsibilities connected to one&rsquo;s occupation.</p>
			<p>The magic of India&rsquo;s spiritual geography comes to life as senior correspondent Rajiv Malik and photographer Arun Mishra guide us through Vrindavan, land of Lord Krishna&rsquo;s childhood. It is said the various adventures of Radha and Krishna still take place nightly in the town&rsquo;s sacred groves of tulsi. They toured the temples old and new and met the town&rsquo;s swamis, scholars, priests and the Bhagawat katha vachaks who daily tell the stories of Krishna&rsquo;s pastimes. Our next issue will take us to nearby Mathura, the site of Krishna&rsquo;s birth.</p>

			<p>Our 16-page Educational Insight for this issue is a foray into the deep philosophies that India has given birth to over the millennia. It&rsquo;s called &ldquo;The Six Streams of Hindu Philosophy: Celebrating Diversity in the Quest for Supreme Knowledge.&rdquo; Written by Mahamahopadhyaya Swami Bhadreshdas, a senior disciple of the late Guru Pramukh Swami Maharaj (who blessed the article in the days before his passing), this is an authoritative English-language overview of these schools of thought. World renowned, Netherlands-based artist Pieter Veltevrede produced seven masterpieces visually depicting the essential characteristics of each darshana.</p>
			<p>Four pages in this issue of the magazine are devoted to a photo essay on the Kumbha Mela in Ujjain, one of Hinduism&rsquo;s sacred cities. It was estimated that 75 million people attended the Mela between April 22 and May 21 of 2016. We&rsquo;ve always been warned about buying fake rudraksha beads, and after discovering a company in Delhi that could determine authenticity using x-rays, we set out to test for fakes. Our reporter bought one to eleven-faced beads from respectable looking shops and ordinary street vendors. We must admit to being happily disappointed that all the beads we purchased were verified as genuine. </p>
			<p>India&rsquo;s rich traditions of Hindu spiritual expression are showcased in our article on the &ldquo;Puja and Piety&rdquo; exhibit in Southern California. British celebrities in the BBC documentary &ldquo;Welcome to the Real Marigold Hotel&rdquo; tell their stories of what retiring to India&mdash;as depicted in the popular film &ldquo;The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel&rdquo;&mdash;might be like. Rounding out the issue is a review of Vamsee Juluri&rsquo;s Rearming Hinduism, a book on the dire need to vigorously defend and bolster our religion within academia and the media. </p>

			<p> With fuel and food prices sky high, it&rsquo;s natural for a family to think about its future financial security. The last place you might think to look for help in such matters is a Hindu monastery. But, in addition to spiritual direction, monasteries around the world offer practical guidance to help stabilize society during changing times. Many of you have supported the monastery for years, and we in turn want to help your family&rsquo;s future. That is one reason the monastery is happy to provide a free, well-thought-out estate planning tool kit. </p>
			<p>A good estate plan will not make high prices lower. But it will protect your family from unnecessary court costs, attorney fees and taxes. These can do real damage, especially at a time when prices continue to trend upward.</p>
			<p>One of the most basic but misunderstood estate planning tools is the will. Some people think a will avoids probate, the costly court process that supervises the distribution of wealth to others at death. Not true. Your will is a ticket to probate court. Think of your will as a letter to the judge, telling him or her who gets your estate. The judge supervises distribution following your will, making sure the right people get the right things......</p>
