             <p>On May 12 Shanmuganathaswami, Siddhanathaswami and I traveled to the US mainland and British Columbia for two-weeks. The programs began in Northern California with personal darshan sessions with devotees and two satsangs—one in Walnut Creek with members and devotees and a second in Fremont with a monthly bhajan group. Next was British Columbia. After a ferry ride to Vancouver Island, events included a shared dinner, special outings and visits to two homes of devotees. Next we were off to Chicago where we enjoyed two satsangs—the first with the Saivite Tamil Foundation group and the second for members and devotees. An outing to Garfield Conservatory was followed by a group lunch. Our final satsang was in Syracuse, New York. My topic at the member satsangs was Gurudeva’s teaching on living two-thirds within and the concept of inner-and-outer consciousness versus up-and-down consciousness. At the general satsangs we talked of dharma, Auvaiyar’s Atti Chudi and “Drawing Close to Lord Ganesha.” While we were traveling, the monastery celebrated Vaikasi Visakan on May 20th with an elaborate abhishekam to Lord Murugan. General contributions for May totaled  $54,328, which is less than our minimum monthly goal of $65,000. Special project contributions totaled an additional $615. We are grateful to our global family of temple builders for your continued and generous support. Aum Namasivaya!</p>

            <p><strong>Iraivan Temple Report</strong><br />
            Through most of May, the skilled stone carvers in Bengaluru, India, worked on Iraivan Temple’s 148-meter-long perimeter wall. At the end of May the carving team spent a week building heavy duty crates, packing finished pieces and loading the crates into shipping containers. Four containers are now on their way to Hawaii! Here on Kauai the main drainage system was installed around the temple. It will drain the rainwater from the foundation plinth and channel it away, thereby helping to prevent erosion. The system is designed to accommodate the heaviest of Kauai’s rains.</p>

            <p><strong>Satguru Bodhinatha Veylanswami's Activities</strong><br />While home in Hawaii, Satguru presented part eight in his series on Patanjali’s teachings in a special class for the youngest monks. He also made a video of his Publisher’s Desk editorial, “Dance and the Spiritual Path,” from the July-August-September issue of our Hinduism Today magazine. The first of Satguru’s weekly talks was “Mindfulness, Being in the Present,” being observant, awakening the superconscious mind and feeling content. You can hear it on our website. Mid-month Satguru traveled to the mainland USA to give a series of informal satsangs on the West Coast, Chicago and Syracuse, New York. At one of the Chicago satsangs, he affectionately fielded some serious questions from two dozen pre-teen and early teenage youth, such as: ”In Hinduism are men and women treated equally? Why are Hindus cremated? Can you be a Hindu if your parents aren’t Hindu? Do wars start because of different religions in different countries?”</p>

            <p><strong>Publications and Other Happenings</strong><br />
            In May the Ganapati Kulam, publications group of monks, worked on Path to Siva, A Catechism for Youth. This book should be ready by November. The monks are also working, with professional help, on an awesome app for digital devices. Also in May, Acharya Arumuganathaswami and Sadhaka Jayanatha flew, once more, to California’s state capital to give testimony at an Instructional Quality Commission meeting. The commission was entering the final phase of review of edits to the California textbook content standards. A list of positive edits, put together by Acharya in collaboration with Professor Shiva Bajpai and other scholars under the auspices of the Uberoi Foundation, had earlier been submitted. These suggestions were well received by the Commission, and quite a few were adopted. Several years ago most Hindus in the US were not aware of these significant proceedings which can result in a better presentation of Hinduism in our nation’s schools. With Acharya’s help, the flame of awareness has been lit across the Hindu community, who will, no doubt, continue working for the cause of getting a proper representation of our faith in the country’s schools in the decades to come. Two young sevaks arrived at the beginning of May, Kodiswara Selvanathan from Malaysia and Dean Drulias from California. Kodiswara helped unpack dozens of Deity statues and Aum bracelets newly arrived from Haridwar and learned how to milk the monastery cows. Dean worked extensively in our digital photo archives. At our Himalayan Acres farm 180 young Noni trees were planted in a newly prepared field. Nine hundred gallons of newly pressed Noni juice was sent to Los Angeles for bottling.</p>

            <h2>Estate Planning in the United Kingdom</h2>
            
            <br />

 <img src="http://www.himalayanacademy.com/html/monastery/newsletter/img/monthly/2016-06-June/hhe.jpg" alt="hhe.jpg" hspace="0" vspace="8" />
            
            <br />

<p>You can find out what you need to know about estate planning in the UK at: 
<a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/index.htm">hmrc.gov.uk/index.htm</a>. 
You can also memorize 
<a href="http://www.shakespeares-sonnets.com">Shakespeare’s 154 sonnets.</a>
</p>
			<p>Both are daunting tasks, especially for Hindu residents adjusting to a culture that uses terms such as “nil rate band” to describe how large an estate has to be before it is subject to inheritance tax: (£325,000 in 2010-11 for a single person, £650,000 for a married couple that has made a proper estate plan).</p>
			<p>Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs website, where estate planning rules are listed, repeatedly pleads with its readers to “seek legal advice,” like an exasperated teacher telling her blank-faced students “it’s all in the text.” But it’s a good place to start.</p>
			<p>Because so much is at stake, HHE presents a few estate planning basics its UK supporters should know.</p>
			<p>1. If your estate is not vulnerable to estate tax, you should still have a will or a trust that specifies how you want your estate distributed. Otherwise, the courts will impose an impersonal formula that may or may not reflect your wishes.</p>
			<p>2. Married couples need a written estate plan, even though no tax is imposed on the death of the first spouse. Without a plan, large estates may be vulnerable to tax at the death of the second spouse if nothing is done to preserve the estate tax exemption of the first to die.</p>
			<p>3. Those who have lost a spouse and then remarried need to provide in writing for children from their first marriage. They should not assume their surviving second spouse will have the same concern for children from their prior marriage.    <a href="http://www.himalayanacademy.com/monastery/newsletter#hhe-news">[More...] </a></p>

				Iraivan Temple is a punya tirtha, a sacred destination for devout pilgrims. The vision of Lord Siva on San Marga that Gurudeva was blessed with in 1975 is sustained and made manifest by the daily sadhanas of 21 resident monastics from five nations. Kadavul Hindu Temple and the many sacred areas of San Marga are available to Hindus for worship, meditation, japa and quiet reflection. It is best, if you are planning to come to visit us, to email us in advance to make sure the days of your visit coincide with our open times. And, if you want to have darshan with Satguru Bodhinatha Veylanswami, to check if he is in residence and to make the necessary appointment.
