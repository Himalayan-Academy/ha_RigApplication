        <p>In the third week of November, Sannyasin Shanmuganathaswami
and I departed for our yearly trip to Singapore and Malaysia. In
Singapore, a satsang was held for members and devotees, plus a
luncheon on the following day. In Malaysia, special visits were made
to the Dharma Shakti Vedanta Gurukulam in Sentul, Kuala Lumpur,
to attend their morning satsang and to the Vanathandavar Temple in
Malacca for a ground-breaking ceremony for their new temple. Visit my Facebook page at <a href="facebook.com/satgurubodhinatha">facebook.com/satgurubodhinatha</a> for more details of the visit. For a second year, on Saturday morning, members coordinated a grand Ekadasa Rudra Homa at the Sri Subramaniya Swami Temple in Kajang—over one thousand devotees attended. My talk was on how Hindu culture is perpetuated by worshiping at the temple. In the evening we gave a presentation in Klang at an event called “Spiritual Empowerment in Business.” On Sunday evening an “Aloha Dinner” was held to bring together members and advanced students. Our new publication, Path to Siva: A Catechism for Youth, was given out as a gift. General contributions for November totalled  $104,641, which exceeded our minimum monthly goal of $65,000. Special project contributions totaled an additional $6,782. We are grateful to our global family of temple builders for your continued and generous support. Aum Namasivaya!</p>

			            <p><strong>Iraivan Temple Report</strong><br />		
		At the Iraivan Temple carving site in Bengaluru, the stone carvers continue their diligent stonework, creating the perimeter wall. Here on Kauai the work on the landscaping around the temple continues. In November the last four exquisite black granite pitham bases for our larger-than-life-size guru statues were set into place along the “Path of the Saivite Gurus”—a meditation path next to the temple. This concluded an 18-year project including design, carving, shipping and final installation. The murtis will now sit for a thousand years, teaching about the prominent gurus of our lineage.</p>
			<p><strong>Satguru Bodhinatha Veylanswami’s Activities</strong><br />On November 12th Satguru presented a webinar, “Stages of Unfoldment in Saiva Siddhanta, Part One,” for devotees around the planet. He also began a series of weekly talks based on the new Path to Siva book (now posted on our website) which is bringing lucid clarifications to key questions faced by Hindu youth, as well as adults. During the final two weeks of November, Satguru, accompanied by Shanmuganathaswami, made his annual visit to Singapore and Malaysia. They received an enthusiastic reception from hundreds of devotees, students, seekers and friends.</p>
			<p><strong>Special Guests</strong><br />
			Sri Sri Jayendra Puri Mahaswamiji, successor of Sri Sri Tiruchi Mahaswamigal, visited the monastery in mid-November for three days. The Kauai monks enjoyed his warm spiritual presence, stories, wit and wisdom. Mahaswamiji is the head of Kailash Ashrama in Bengaluru, one of South India’s renowned religious institutions. Following the Sri Vidya tradition, the ashram’s grand temple enshrines Goddess Rajarajeswari. Two priests traveling with Mahaswamiji conducted a special homa to invoke blessings for success in our major projects. Their intense schedule then took them to mainland America and the UK.</p>
			<p><strong>Publications and Other Activities</strong><br />
			Our free Spiritual Workout App is now available on Google Play as well as Apple’s App Store. On November first, a year-end Digital Dharma fund-raising drive was begun on our websites to fund the further development of digital content in 2017. At the beginning of November, the monks celebrated the final day of Skanda Shasthi with an abhishekam to Lord Skanda in Kadavul Temple. During the ceremony, Namrata Ragade of Oregon received Mantra Diksha from Satguru, pledging to chant the Panchakshara mantra 108 times each day without fail. Following the abhishekam, Brahmachari Raguram was given the new monastic name Kanthanatha, as well as a japa mala and a “Namah Sivaya” bracelet. Kanthanatha will continue his training in the monastery until he is ready to take his Postulant vows. In November we had a record number of Task Force volunteers in residence. Aditya Vinadhara of Utah and Jnanideva Cevvel of Edmonton, Canada, installed tongue-and-groove camphor boards on the soffit of the recently renovated Media Studio. Roshan Sivayogam of Malaysia worked on landscaping and gardening projects. Adi Srikantha of Utah/Washington, here for a full three months, is helping the monks with repairing, maintaining and upgrading our agricultural equipment. Dean Drulias of California spent the month giving fresh energy to our landscaping, noni production, MiniMela gift shop and helping in the Media Studio with publications and web posts. Thanks to them all! The monastery’s “Wailua River Noni Juice,” grown organically on our Himalayan Acres farm and processed by the monks, is into its second bottling. The Down to Earth health food stores on Oahu are now holding demonstration samplings of the juice at all four of their locations. We have planted an additional 520 noni trees, in part replacing some that were not doing well. In the next two to three years these new trees will greatly increase our fruit production. In November, the farm hosted Tyler Jones, manager of the Hawaii Agriculture Research Center’s Maunawili Substation, which was the source of seedlings for our eight-acre Koa plantation. </p>

<p><i>Left: The cover of Path to Siva and lesson 16, on the sacred Namah Shivaya mantra</i> </p>
            <br />

           <p>Satguru Bodhinatha Veylanswami and the Ganapati Kulam have completed a brand new book with 68 questions and answers on Saivite Hinduism for teens, about 12 to 15. Path to Siva, a Catechism for Youth serves as an answer to the often repeated query from parents and teachers: “We need one complete but simple course we can teach to our kids!” </p>
			<p>It was developed from the fourth book of Saivite Hindu Religion which had 35 questions drawn from Dancing with Siva. We reached out to teachers in four different countries to get a list of additional subjects they wanted to cover in their classes. Our team added more topics, expanding the book to 68 subjects addressed in question and answer form. The design was upgraded to a modern look and feel to appeal to the current generation. The book was released for Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami’s 2016 Mahasamadhi. We know he would be delighted to see his teachings take this bold new form for the next generation. </p>
			<p>The book’s questions range from metaphysical to the mundane and include: Who am I and where did I come from? What is the ultimate goal of life? What are the beliefs of Saivism? What are the path’s four stages? Why is the satguru so important? How do we receive guests? and How do we treat the environment? Answers are based on Dancing with Siva, Merging with Siva and Living with Siva. Some lessons are definitely more advanced than others, especially those that summarize complex philosophy. Thus parents and teachers may want to select what to teach to younger children.</p>
			<p>Lesson One begins, “Seekers ask: ‘Who am I and where did I come from?’ They inwardly know they are more than just another person with a particular name who was born in a certain place. They sense that they are more than their body, mind and emotions. They want to understand, ‘Did I exist before I was born? Will I exist after death?’ The answer given in Saivite Hinduism is that we are each a divine soul on a wondrous journey. We are an immortal body of light that has lived many lives, had many bodies and personalities.”</p>
			<p>In his regular talk following the homa ceremony which begins our lunar week here at Kauai Aadheenam, Satguru Bodhinatha Veylanswami is giving commentary on the lessons. These are being recorded, transcribed and published on TAKA. We plan to use these talks to develop teaching materials to supplement the book, including lesson plans created by individual teachers.</p>
			<p>The book is available for free online (himalayanacademy.com/view/path-to-siva) in various ebook formats including as a Microsoft Word document which allows teachers to extract text for classroom worksheets. It has been printed as a hardbound book, now available at minimela.com.</p>

            <br />

 <p>With this year’s challenges and accomplishments still fresh in your mind, now is a good time to review your estate and financial plans. To help you in this process, we have assembled the following checklist of actions for you to go over as the end of the year approaches. </p>
			<ul>
	<li> Review your current will and trusts. These may need to be updated because of major changes in your life, such as births, deaths, marriages or a move to a different state.</li>
	<li>			Review the beneficiary designations for your life insurance and retirement plans to make sure your beneficiary isn’t someone who is now deceased or a former spouse.</li>
	<li>			Make sure your durable power of attorney for health care and living will are current. These medical documents should be updated and on file with family members and health care providers. Discuss decisions regarding anatomical gifts with your family.</li>
	<li>			Take inventory and make a written record of the contents of any safe-deposit box. Give a copy to a trusted family member and note any items you are holding for someone else that don’t belong to you.</p></li>
	<li>			Name designated heirs to receive bank account proceeds at your death.</li>
	<li>			Be sure you are comfortable with the guardian named in your will for those under your care, such as minor children or a loved one who is disabled.</li>
</ul>
