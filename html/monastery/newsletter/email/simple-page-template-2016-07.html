                 <p>The last week of June Sannyasin Shanmuganathaswami and I flew to London for a week of events and gatherings. Morning and evening temple visits took us to London Sri Murugan Temple, Enfield Nagapoosani Ambaal Temple, Highgate Hill Murugan Temple, Sr Rajarajeswari Amman Temple and London Sivan Kovil. Each temple visit included a short talk  with Tamil translation on the personal form of the Deity being real, the existence of three worlds and how the Deity resides in the sacred murti during puja and blesses the devotees present. A three-hour workshop on "What Is Saivism?" was given to some seventy bhaktars at the Wimbledon Shree Ghanapathy Temple. Additionally, two satsangs for members and devotees were held, plus an outing to the internationally renowned Kew Botanical Gardens, an Aloha Dinner, a visit to Shanti Nilayam (Yogaswami Hall) to meet Yogaswami devotees plus some private darshan meetings. General contributions for June totaled $37,198, which is far less than our minimum monthly goal of $65,000. Special project contributions totaled an additional $3,554.  We are grateful to our global family of temple builders for your continued and generous support. Aum Namasivaya!</p>

            <p><strong>Iraivan Temple Report</strong><br />
            Through the month of June the skilled stone carvers in Bengaluru, India, worked on Iraivan Temple's perimeter wall. At the end of May the carving team spent a week loading crates holding about one-fourth of the completed perimeter wall stones into four shipping containers. The containers are now onboard a ship enroute to Honolulu. They are scheduled to arrive on July 21st. The containers also carry stone bases for the silpi bronzes and four bases for the Guru Parampara statues.</p>

            <p><strong>Satguru Bodhinatha Veylanswami's Activities</strong><br />London was the big news of the month, and every day was filled and overfilled with events. Amazingly, Pitchai Gurukkal was present at the temples, on his way to the same event in Maryland as Satguru. Every few months Satguru holds a class on Patanjali's Yoga Sutra for our youngest monks. The June class compared the Sutras with Gurudeva's teachings. The class included the intricacies of various types of Samadhi, such as samadhi with form (savikalpa samadhi), whereby the observer, the observed and the act of observing coalesce into oneness; and samadhi without form (nirvikalpa samadhi), in which awareness transcends even the highest experiences and dissolves in the timeless, spaceless, absolute Self. All in all it was a fun and informative class for everyone. On June 25 Satguru continued this exploration in a webinar with his initiated devotees around the world.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Monastic Visitors</strong><br />The monastery was honored to have Swami Ramana Swaroopananda and Brahmachari Vrajvihari Sharan visiting us for several days in June. Brahmachari had just arrived from London on the 26th just in time to see Satguru off on his flight to&hellip;.London! Brahmachari is a major force in the global work of his guruji, Shri Gopal Sharan, whose garden-like ashram, Golok Dham, is located in New Delhi. When he was 11 years old growing up in London, Vrajvihari Sharan encountered Gurudeva's book, Dancing with Siva, and has longed ever since that day to visit the monastery in Hawaii. For the past few months he has been preparing a biography of the founding guru of his lineage, Nimbarka Acharya, which will be published in a future issue of Hinduism Today. Swami Ramana Swaroopananda, who now has an 8-acre ashram in Tiruvannamalai, a devotee of Ramana Maharishi, began as a brahmachari under the tutelage of Swami Tejomayananda, head of the Chinmaya Mission. Later Swamiji was initiated as an acharya and sent on mission to Sri Lanka from 1998 to 2006. During that time, a copy of Siva Yogaswami's Natchintanai was presented to Swamiji, and Swamiji found himself captivated by the teachings therein. Swamiji went to Jaffna to seek out Sellathuraiswami, who mentored him in the deeper meaning of Yogaswami's songs. In addition to meeting with Satguru and the swamis of the monastery, our visitors were taken out to experience the beauty of Kauai.</p>

            <p><strong>Publications and Other Happenings</strong><br />
            June 14th marked the 200th time that the monthly Chitra Nakshatra Pada Puja was performed for Gurudeva since his passing on November 12, 2001. And for the 200th time, we all gathered in Kadavul Temple to honor that great Natha Rishi with a heartfelt puja to him. In 1970 Gurudeva produced a 12-hour Audio Master Course that transformed the lives of thousands of seekers. That course, which lays out the core metaphysics of spiritual evolution in lucid but simple terms, was just digitized and added to our website. An ocean of red tape was finally crossed in June when we gained approval to film portions of part 4 and part 5 of our History of Hindu India documentaries at various locations in India. Our publications team here in Hawaii has been hard at work on the October-November-December issue of Hinduism Today. Nine hundred gallons of organic Noni juice, grown on our Himalayan Acres farm, has arrived in Los Angeles where it will be bottled, labeled and returned to us for sale on all the Hawaiian islands. Hundreds more Koa trees were also planted on the farm.</p>

            <h2>Durable Power of Attorney: When You Do<br />Need to Give Others Control of Your Property</h2>
            
            <br />
            
            <img src="http://www.himalayanacademy.com/html/monastery/newsletter/img/monthly/2016-07-July/hhe.jpg" alt="hhe.jpg" hspace="0" vspace="8" />
            
            <br />

			<p>Are you out of your mind?" So thought Aditya&mdash;a well-traveled engineer in his forties with an international client base&mdash;when his attorney first suggested he name someone to control his bank accounts, make his mortgage payments and complete and sign his taxes.</p>
			<p >Too polite to speak his misgivings, Aditya revealed them in his face. "No, no. I'm not asking you to give away the store," the attorney assured with a smile. "These powers would spring to life only when you need them."</p>
			<p >"For example?"</p>
			<p >"Let's say you had a serious accident on one of your trips. Doctors confirm you can't manage your finances for a while. If you have completed a durable power of attorney for property management and finance, someone you have chosen could immediately pay your medical bills and mortgage."</p>
			<p >"And if I haven't done this, what would happen?" Aditya queried.</p>
			<p >"Without it, the court would have to appoint a conservator for you," the attorney said with a grimace. "That's called, logically enough, a court conservatorship. In some cases it's the only solution, but, believe me, you want to avoid it if you can. It's expensive and unpleasant. After all, they have to discuss your mental competence in public, and in the end they may appoint someone you would not want."</p>
			<p >"'Power of attorney' does not imply an actual attorney, does it?</p>
			<p >"No. Attorney is used in the broad sense of someone acting in your place and on your behalf, not an attorney-at-law, like me."</p>
			<p >"How important is this document?"</p>
			<p >"Well, once after I had given an estate planning seminar and reviewed the tools of the trade, an emergency-room nurse who was in the audience spoke up. 'Accidents happen. Everyone should have a durable power of attorney for property management, no matter what your age, if you own property and have bills'."</p>
			<p >"Is it a long document?"</p>
			<p >"It can be, depending on what you want your representative to do," the attorney said. "But this is typical," he added, handing Aditya something that looked like an accountant's to-do list. It read:</p>
			<p >&bull;&#9;Make deposits and withdrawals from bank accounts</p>
			<p >&bull;&#9;Sign tax returns and appoint qualified individuals to represent the principal with the IRS in order to make investment decisions</p>
			<p >&bull;&#9;Deal with retirement plans, including IRAs</p>
			<p >&bull;&#9;Have access to the principal's safe-deposit box</p>
			<p >&bull;&#9;Create a living trust and fund a previously created living trust </p>
			<p >&bull;&#9;Revoke or change beneficiary designations</p>
			<p >&bull;&#9;Vote the principal's stock</p>
			<p >&bull;&#9;Forgive or collect the principal's debts</p>
			<p >&bull;&#9;Enter into contracts on behalf of the principal</p>
			<p >&bull;&#9;Make gifts on behalf of the principal</p>
			<p >&bull;&#9;Disclaim gifts or bequests made to the principal</p>
			<p >&bull; &#9;Deal with life insurance on the life of the principal</p>
			<p >There were a few people, very few, to whom Aditya would give these powers. He did not relish a judge he did not know making that choice for him.</p>
			<p >"Let's get it drafted," he declared firmly.</p>

				Iraivan Temple is a punya tirtha, a sacred destination for devout pilgrims. The vision of Lord Siva on San Marga that Gurudeva was blessed with in 1975 is sustained and made manifest by the daily sadhanas of 21 resident monastics from five nations. Kadavul Hindu Temple and the many sacred areas of San Marga are available to Hindus for worship, meditation, japa and quiet reflection. It is best, if you are planning to come to visit us, to email us in advance to make sure the days of your visit coincide with our open times. And, if you want to have darshan with Satguru Bodhinatha Veylanswami, to check if he is in residence and to make the necessary appointment.
