/ssc/hawaii/iraivan/newletter/images/monthly/

We are not archiving Iraivan newsletters on the web. Therefore the images from past newsletters are all orphans and should be routinely deleted.

 This needs to be done on the distribution server (at least) the mirror will then delete them locally. If you just delete them locally, they will be restored later by the mirror.

If you ever want to get the images back, oen the original newsletter in InDesign, export to Dreamweaver, images optimized and formatted. names will be different of course.
