               <br /> If you want to give a donation directly to Bodhinatha for him to use at his discretion or donate to the temple, see below. You gift will encourage the many projects Gurudeva has set in motion and which Bodhinatha is carrying forward. Or to simply do something for the monks in appreciation of their work. This page is a response to all the good souls who wish to help. We know each of you is inspired by different things, so we will work to keep a broad spectrum of the needs (or wants) on this page, from high-tech stuff to warm socks for the monks, from small items to serious improvements that we could not otherwise afford to implement. Please feel free to sponsor part of a project, even if you feel you cannot sponsor the whole thing. Every dollar counts!</p>
            <p>If you are interested in sponsoring a project or need that is not listed below, please send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:sadasivanatha@hindu.org">sadasivanatha@hindu.org</a>.</p>

Made entirely by hand, not using a single machine, from stone in India and shipped to Hawaii. This will be an historic gift to the future generations of Hindus around the world. Don't miss the opportunity to participate today! <a href="https://www.hheonline.org/donate/iraivan_temple.shtml">Click to help build one the most remarkable temples in the world.</a></p>

              <h2 class="h2">Help Build Meditation Huts on San Marga</h2>       
<img src="/html/donations/img/meditation-hut_600px.jpg" width="324" alt="Meditation Hut" class="float-left" />
<p><b>Summary:</b> 
Monks and pilgrims alike are invited to wander the sacred grounds that surround Iraivan Temple and to take time to sit down and go within, but the mosquitoes and rain can make prolonged meditation almost impossible.
 
Working for almost a year in his spare time, one of the monks made a small prototype meditation hut out of old growth redwood to solve this problem and now it rests in a secluded spot on the Path of the Saivite Saints. The tranquil setting makes meditation easy as one goes within and then comes back out to the sounds of waterfalls and wild birds.
 
Bodhinatha would like to see three more meditation huts in other secluded spots on San Marga and we would like to use the gentle skills of master craftsman Jeff Schott to make them for us. The cost of each hut, including his time, is estimated at $6,000 each.

                    <h2 class="h2">Feed the Monks</h2>
            <p><b>Summary:</b> We are often asked by devotees if they can feed the monks. The answer is yes. This is an ancient and traditional form of giving known in Sanskrit as anna dana, feeding the sadhus. It is common for devotees to choose a day to honor a family member or celebrate some sacred or important event in their life.</p>
            <p>The challenge is that we are in the middle of the Pacific, and you may be living in London, Chennai or Brazil.</p>
            <p>The preferred way that devotees accomplish this is to make a cash donation to the monastery, specifying that it is to provide a meal for the monks. We usually do such special meals on festival days or when something special is happening in the monastery. The monks gather for their shared lunch in the Peacock Court to enjoy a change of diet for one day. An additional boon: those who generally cook have a day off.</p>
            <p><b>Cost:</b> Such a meal on this all-too-expensive island costs on average  $20.00 per person. A donation of $440.00 will feed all the monks at Kauai's Hindu Monastery (currently 22). When making arrangements with the monastery, it is helpful to say, "Please use this donation to sponsor a meal for all the monks."

            <h2 class="h2">Help Us Acquire Sacred Plants</h2>
            <p><b>Summary:</b> The monastery is collecting the sacred, legendary, fragrant and medicinal plants of India and Sri Lanka, and creating a magical botanical garden on Kauai. These are of course part of creating a divine and awesome tropical garden, Siva's Garden, for pilgrims to enjoy. Additionally, this plant collection is part of a long-term plan to create a Hawaiian repository of these natural gifts, a place where they are nurtured, propagated and made available to others. </p>
            <p><b>Cost:</b> US$125 or more. You can make your secure donation online. <a href="https://donate.himalayanacademy.com/donate.shtml">Click here to go to a secure donation form.</a> </p>
