Hindu music is very creative and professionally trained Carnatic singers have a great deal of freedom for improvisation, much like modern western jazz musicians. But this leaves the average lay person with a big problem as well as teachers of groups or children when they come to learn the song. &quot;How should we sing it? What is the tune?&quot; To facilitate the dissemination of Yogaswami's songs the Swamis at Kauai Aadheenam have selected standardized tunes. Wherever possible we have tried to source these melodies from the Sri Lankan Jaffna community itself. Sometimes a complicated carnatic melody by a professional Jaffna Tamil singer has been simplified. (Gamakams are reduced for children) In cases where melodies are not known or are &quot;boring&quot; from a modern youth angle, we have adopted a more rhythmic, upbeat melody. We have to give credit to the Tiruvadi Niliyam (Jaffna Sai Baba devotees) who have sponsored some recordings by the All Ceylon Radio Singers for leading the way in this regard. These are good examples of Yogaswami's songs sung in a pleasing style. It is well known that Yogaswami himself did on occasion tell his devotees to sing such-and-such a Natchintanai song according to the melody of a song sung by one of the current popular devotional singers of his day. The melodies for many Natchintanai have yet to be selected for groups and children. If you would care to suggest some tunes we would very much appreciate your suggestions.
